Climate change affects the environment in many different ways. For example, many places have experienced changes in rainfall, resulting in more floods, droughts, or intense rain, as well as more frequent and severe heat waves. The planet's oceans and glaciers have also experienced changesâ€”oceans are warming, ice caps are melting, and sea levels are rising. Climate change happens globally, but effects differ locally.

  

We all know that climate change is due to a global warming, which refers to a global temperature increase coming from human-made greenhouse gases in the planet since 1850s, and will continue to happen and worsen as long as humans add more greenhouse gas emissions to the atmosphere. Severe weather damage will also increase and intensify. Today, some effects of climate change are becoming more frequent than expected, as according to Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC, 2021). These changes can't be undone over the next hundreds to thousands of years.

  

The IPCC's special report about global warming, published in October 2018, found that greenhouse gases caused by human activities have already warned the climate by approximately 1.0 Celsius, and is expected to reach 1.5 Celsius around 2040 if the temperature continues to increase at current rate. The Paris Agreement, adopted in December 2015, aims to limit the temperature rise below 2.0 Celsius before this century. These changes will affect all regions of Earth.

  

However, that's not all. Not only it affects our environment, climate change impacts our society because it also affects things that we depend upon and value, like water, energy, transportation, wildlife, agriculture, ecosystems, and human health.

  

According to the Fifth National Climate Assessment (USGCRP, 2023), climate change impacts human health and well-being through extreme heat, extreme weather events, wildfires, infectious diseases, and water. Higher temperatures are associated with increased heat-related illness and death (e.g. heat exhaustion and stroke), particularly for children, pregnant women, and elderly. It can also contribute to increased hospitalizations related to cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, and respiratory problems.

  

Extreme weather events like droughts, hurricanes and typhoons, and wildfires will not only put people's lives at risk, but can also worsen underlying medical conditions, increase stress, and lead to adverse mental health effects. For example, the ongoing drought in Kenya due to a lack of rain in recent years, resulted in not only people and animals struggling and increasing demands for food and water, but caused pollution of groundwater and surface water which contains viruses, bacteria, and other contaminants. People who get their drinking water with these contaminants from private wells may be at higher risk for drought-related infectious diseases (CDC, 2024).

  

The Typhoon Man-yi (known as Super Typhoon Pepito) caused 14 deaths, destroyed 16,433 homes and damaging 60,498 others in the Philippines, as reported by National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council (NDRRMC, 2024). At least 4 million people were affected. The storm impacted the agricultural industry in places like Nueva Ecija, where the fields were submerged due to severe flooding, which disrupted the rice production. The agricultural damage amounted to 12 million pesos. Ferry transportations were suspended, and also some provinces went powerless temporarily because of heavy winds and/or fallen trees affecting power lines caused by the storm.

  

The Palisades and Eaton wildfire in Los Angeles killed at least 28 people, and destroyed over 10,000 structures. Smoke from the fires caused severe air pollution, with residents advised to wear N95 or P100 masks in areas marked as unhealthy on the Air Quality Index (DPH of Los Angeles County, 2025). Exposure to wildfire smoke will cause burning eyes, runny nose, scratchy throat, headaches and illness. People at higher risk with respiratory or heart conditions, and people with compromised immune systems may experience more severe effects such as difficulty breathing, coughing, fatigue, and/or chest pain.

  

So, that's all I can say about climate change and its effects on our daily life. It impacts not only the environment of our planet, but also it harms our society through heatwaves, droughts, storms, and others. Currently, there are attempts to mitigate the global warming, like the Paris Agreement. What are your thoughts after reading this essay? Let me know.
