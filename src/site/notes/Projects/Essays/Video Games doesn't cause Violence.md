As a gamer and also former gaming addict myself, it's really sad to see people linking between video games' use and mass homicide. Even the 45th and 47th President of the United States Donald Trump, who is also a convinced felon, blames violent video games for those mass violences back in 2019, after two mass shootings in the span of 24 hours in Texas. 

> *We must stop the glorification of violence in our society. This includes the gruesome and grisly video games that are now commonplace. It is too easy today for troubled youth to surround themselves with a culture that celebrates violence. We must stop or substantially reduce this and it has to begin immediately.*

At that time, there were also other politicians targeting video games in response after these gun violences occurred there.

In fact, blaming video games for violence is merely a distraction from other factors. News media often began to point violent video game use as a potential contributor to acts of mass homicide ever since the Columbine massacre in 1999, when they found out that one of the perpetrators had history of creating addon levels for *Doom*, *Doom II*, and *Quake* used for practice for "*mass murder*", three of which were allegedly based on Columbine High School despite they were made three years before the massacre while the perpetrators are believed to begun plotting the shooting about two years after that time. No further concrete information concerning these levels has ever emerged, leading to much speculation.

There have been numerous studies regarding the effects of violent video game use for more than two decades, but no sufficient evidence was ever made.
