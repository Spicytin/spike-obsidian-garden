# INTRODUCTION

In a world full of wonder, women have gained superpowers since the beginning of ancient times. Each woman has different powers after birth, ranging from strength to invisibility, which can be passed down from generation to generation. 

  

In this world, there is a story that tells of tradition, action, and a longing wish to possess these powers.

# THE STORY

At the Lake of Mount Halcon, a man named Edmund had been living alone deep in the forest, five years after his parents disappeared. One night, he encountered a beautiful woman who was lost, trembling with fear. She began to pass out. The man hesitated, suspecting that the woman might be dangerous, but he decided to let her into his house and took care of her after feeling pity for her. The woman woke up the next morning, pale and so thin that it was obvious she hadn't eaten in days. She introduced herself as Kristina. She claimed that a few days ago, she and her parents were being chased by unknown men through the woods until her father and mother were kidnapped. After her father told her to run as far as possible, she ran and hid in the forest.

  

Two years later, after experiencing the trauma that she had, Kristina was finally happy being with the man. She learned new things and was living her best life, even though she misses her past life of luxury with her wealthy family since when she was born. However, they both realized that they share a deep connection—something they have in common: love.

  

After getting to know each other, Kristina revealed her darkest secret to Edmund—she admitted that she had an ability to fly.

  

Because of the unexpected turn of events, a beautiful young girl named Alexi was born with a small, cute nose, pinkish lips like her mother’s, her father’s hair color, and eyes that sparkled like stars at night.

  

Alexi also gained a superhuman strength after she was born, inherited from her mother. Edmund and Kristina hid it from Alexi to avoid trouble. After Alexi became an adult, they decided to move to the city and live a normal life, just as her mom had before.

While she and her parents are still adjusting after living in the city for quite some time, Alexi applied for the position of assistant at a large company Clerk M., a retail giant owned by one of the most successful businesswomen and CEO, Chiara. Being happy with her job, Alexi spent a long time working at the company and eventually got promoted to Co-CEO after 3 years.

  

One night, Alexi heard a noise in a basement while she was returning to her office after getting a hot coffee. When she went to see what was inside there, she gasped to see boxes of drugs sitting in that room. Wondering why there were so many of them, she decided to examine the boxes until she was interrupted by someone approaching the room. Before she gets caught, she hides in a big box in the room where she wouldn’t be seen.

  

While being hidden, Alexi heard two people talking.

"We need to deliver the drugs to Mr. Lee"

Alexi recognized this voice, whispers to herself, "Is that Mrs. Chiara?".

She and her worker continued to talk about the drugs until Chiara's phone rang, "Kringggg.......Kringgggg......". She then answers it.

"Yes Mr. Lee?..... Oh, don't worry, we'll deliver them next week..... Alright, bye."

Chiara closed the call and the two walked out of the basement. Before Alexi left, she took the pictures of the boxes and sent them to her friend Mira. A day later, Alexi lies to Chiara that she will take off from work for a week due to vacation.

  

A week later on the day of the transaction, Alexi and Mira were outside Clerk M. in a car, waiting for Chiara to show up. When Chiara exits out of the building to the parking lot, Alexi saw her holding the same boxes of drugs that Alexi found in the basement. As Chiara walked to her car with the drugs, Alexi and Mira tried to follow her. They ended up outside a warehouse where Chiara was in there. When the transaction ended, she and her staff left the warehouse. Before they were about to board, Chiara noticed Alexi and Mira inside. Chiara then alerted her staff to chase them. While they ran as fast as they could, they were caught up by her armed men.

  

"Pow.... Pow...", Alexi was able to fight against Chiara's men with no injuries. Realized that she saw Alexi's unusual strength, Chiara immediately left the warehouse and went to her car. She thought of investigating Alexi to find out why she had that strength.

  

Alexi went home safely, shocked and amazed by her new discovered superpower. She tested her ability by lifting the boulders in the forest behind her house, then threw them very far away. Excited, Alexi thought of confessing her power to her parents, and so she did.

  

When her parents Edmund and Kristina came home, she ran down the stairs from her bedroom to greet and tell them about her strange superpower.

"Mom! Dad! I know you might not be going to believe me, but... I'm not an ordinary girl!!!"

Her parents looked at each other confused and laughed at Alexi.

"Just knew, huh?" Kristina smiles, as if she saw her throwing those heavy stones while driving back home.

Alexi was shocked that her mother had known all long that she had her superpower in her whole life. She became mad at her for the fact that she did not tell her daughter that she had the superpower since she was a baby. Alexi went back to her room, mumbling and crying. Kristina later walked to Alexi's room and said that if she told her about her ability when she was younger, then she would use it for bad purposes. After hearing the truth, Alexi forgave her mother.

  

After that moment, Alexi claimed that Chiara, her boss, was actually secretly involved in one of the drug syndicates, and that she and her friend were recently attacked by her men when they try to find out her real job.

  

Meanwhile, Chiara contacted one of her professional hacker friends, Val. She asked him to gather Alexi's information from government civil files using his own gadget so she can know where she lives. After digging through the files, Val finally found Alexi's info, including the exact location of her home. He sends it to Chiara's direct messages. Chiara then sends highly lethal men to her location to capture Alexi and do experiments with her.

  

The next morning, Alexi woke up and heard a knock at her front door. She answered the door and immediately lost consciousness when one of Chiara's men stabbed her with a syringe. The men dumped her in the trunk of their car and drove.

  

Alexi woke up again but tied to a chair in the basement of her company's building, where she found the drugs a week ago. She saw Chiara standing in front of her. Chiara told all the secrets about her business, including the drug syndicate. She wanted to gain Alexi's powers with her knowledge by diverting Alexi's DNA to her, so she began the experiment. During this, Chiara started to be confused when she couldn't feel Alexi's superhuman strength. Then suddenly, the basement door went bang. The police officers showed up and arrested Chiara.

  

Alexi revealed that this was a setup that she and Kristina had planned. Last night, she and her mother were aware that Chiara would kidnap her soon. During her kidnapping, Kristina was able to track Chiara men's car to find her whereabouts and report it to police. Alexi also revealed that she had a voice recorder hiding in her pocket she prepared earlier before she was kidnapped, recording the entire conversation between her and Chiara that includes her secret business info, along with the mentions of the syndicate. Alexi gave the recorder to the police and said, "Ma'am Chiara, you will be imprisoned and must pay for all your wrongdoings."

  

Alexi realized that her newfound strength brought responsibilities that her could not ignore.

  

After Chiara was arrested, the news announced that one of the largest drug syndicates in the country had been successfully destroyed, which became exploded in the media. The boss of this syndicate, Mr. Lee, was also arrested.

  

—A year had passed since Ma’am Chiara’s arrest. At first, she never regretted that she was imprisoned, because she just did what he wanted to do before, but now she is no longer hindered in Kristina and Alexi’s life. Alexi's identity has been protected to keep her powers secret and her safety intact.

  

After the incident, Alexi resigned from her position at Clerk M. That paved the way for Alexi to start a new life with Kristina and Edmund, her parents. That day was the best day of their lives, because the person who tried to mess with them is no longer be hindered in their life.

  

Alexi is still learning the power she had, while her mother is always there for her to accompany and guide her. The next day... She began to train intensively with her mother, not only in physical power but in learning control and strategy, ensuring that she would be ready for any challenge that came her way.

  

One night, the family gathered behind their house, overlooking the forest. They saw the moon and stars that light up the sky, giving calmness and peace around them.

  

Alexi's father, Edmund, cooked a grilled fish caught from the lake for their dinner, while Kristina sat next to Alexi on a wooden chair, watching the stars twinkle in the night sky. Kristina and Alexi made the most of their time together and are trying to make a good relationship with each other.

"Do you think things will stay like this?"

Alexi asked his mother. "Peace isn't always something you find, my dear. It's something you create. And together, we've built this."

Edmund joined them, placing the fish on the table. "Your mother is right. We faced the darkness, but we came out stronger, closer. And as long as we protect each other, we can face anything."

“We’ve come a long way,” Alexi thought, her heart full of gratitude. She glanced at her parents, and they exchanged a knowing smile.

  

Despite the extraordinary powers and challenges they carried, they were, at their core, a family—and that was their greatest strength.
