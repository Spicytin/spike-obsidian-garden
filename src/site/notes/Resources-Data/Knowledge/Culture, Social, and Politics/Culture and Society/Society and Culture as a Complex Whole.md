## Beliefs
Conceptions that people accept as ==true== about ==how the world operates and where individuals fit in it==. These ideas help people ==make sense of the world== â€” how things work, why things happen, and what is right or wrong.

## Values
==General and shared perception== of what is good, right, appropriateness, worthwhile, and important with regard to modes of conduct as in the cast of self-reliance or obedience.

## Norms
All societies have guidelines that ==govern moral standards== and even the most routine aspects of life. Sociologist call the written and unwritten rules that specify the behaviors appropriate to specific situations as **norms**

***William Graham Sumner*** (*1907*), a classical liberal American social scientist, distinguished between **folkways** and **mores**:
* **Folkways** - norms that apply to ==routine matters== like eating, sleeping, appearance, posture, use of appliances, and relations to various people, animals, and the environment.
* **Mores** - norms that people define as ==pivotal to the well-being of the group==. People who violate **mores** are usually ==punished== through imprisonment, institutionalized sanctions, or are executed.

## Symbols
They are any kind of ==physical phenomenon==- a word, an object, a color, a sound, a feeling, an odor, a movement, or a taste to which people assign a meaning or value (***Ferrante***, *1995*).

** **
***Dr. Felipe Landa Jocano***, a Filipino anthropologist, Professor Emeritus at the *Asian Center of the University of the Philippines*, and an authority on the subject of Filipino society and culture, showed evidence that **individualism** is ==not part of traditional Filipino culture==. His studies pointed to elements of:
* **pakikitungo** - smooth interpersonal relations
* **pakikisama** - to be sensitive, concerned, and supportive; and
* **pakikiramay** - to sympathize and share sufferings

## Elements that constitute the Filipino value system
* **Halaga** - evaluative aspect as to what Filipinos find ==most virtuous== which constitute three dimensions:
	A. **pagkatao** or self-worth
	B. **pakikipagkapwa-tao** or dignified relationship with others.
	C. **pagkamakatao** or compassion
* **Asal** - expression of the evaluative aspect of Filipino value system which constitute three standards:
	A. **kapwa** or relational
	B. **damdamin** or emotional
	C. **dangal** or honor
* **Diwa** -*kalooban* or inner self which in essence is ==intertwined reason and emotion==.
