## Culture
One of the ==most complex words in the English language==. **Culture** is used to denote that which is ==related to the arts and humanities==. In a broader sense, **culture** denotes the ==practices, beliefs, and traditions== of a given society.

There is wide agreement that **culture**:
* Is learned from other people while growing up in a particular society or group.
* Is widely shared by the members of the society and group.
* So profoundly affects the thought, actions, and feeling of people in that group that anthropologists say that "*individuals are a product of their culture*" and "*learning a culture is an essential part of human development*".
* In large part, accounts for the differences between groups of people in how they act, think, and feel.

### Culture in sociology and anthropology
* Descriptive definitions view **culture** as a total system of customs, beliefs, knowledge, laws means of expression, and so forth.
* Historical definitions view **culture** as the ==continuation of generations==.
* Normative definitions of **culture** relates to value systems that construct ==social and personal behavior==.
* Psychological definitions of **culture** stresses its self in interpersonal relations.
* Structural definitions of **culture** focuses on relation aspects of cultural components through ==abstraction==.
* Sociogenetic definitions of **culture** focuses on the ==genesis and continued existence== of a **culture**.

## Anthropological Perspective of Culture and Society
The distinction between "*elite culture*" and "*popular*" culture is ==largely irrelevant== in anthropological discussions, and it is meaningless to say that one group of people has "*more culture*" than another.

## Sociological Perspective of Culture and Society
Sociologically speaking, **culture** is the ==perspective== people come to ==share as they interact==.

Sociologist distinguish between **culture** and **society**. A **society** is a ==group of people living in a given territory== who ==share a culture== and who interact with people of that territory more than with people of other territory.
