For many reasons, it can be said that most people take the social world for granted. In this age of high-speed development and technological breakthroughs, people feel that they need to be competitive in order to survive that the rat race that is life.

To become responsible citizens, however, we have to be '*sociologically aware*' individuals. It will help to be aware of the distinction made by sociologist [***C. Wright Mills***](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C._Wright_Mills) in his book entitled: ***The Sociological Imagination*** (*1959*).

## Troubles
==Private matters== that can be explained in terms of personal characteristics i.e. motivation levels, mood, personality, or ability as well as immediate relationships with family members, acquaintances, or co-workers.

## Issues
... On the other hand, are ==public matters== that can be explained by factors outside the individual's control and immediate environment.

** **
The relation between **troubles** and **issues** is fundamental to what this book in understanding culture, society, and politics is all about. It enhances our ability to ==link seemingly impersonal and remote societal forces== to our own individual lives.

*Mills* believes that people need a "*quality of life that will help them to use the information*" in a way that they can think about "*what is going on in the world and of what may be happening within themselves*". *Mills* calls this ==quality of mind== the "**sociological imagination**"

## Sociological imagination
Having this **sociological imagination**, people can view ==their inner life and human career== in terms of larger historical forces. The advantages for those who posses this quality of mind is that they can understand their own experiences by ==locating themselves in history==. They can recognize the responses available to them by becoming ==aware== of all the individuals who ==share the same situations as themselves==.
