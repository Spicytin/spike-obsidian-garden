Many quantities in mechanics can be described, not only by their amount, but by their directions as well (e.g. **gravity**, **velocity**, and **force**.).

These two describe the variety of motion concepts.

## Scalars
* These are the quantities that do not need to be defined by a direction.
* The data they provide answer only the question =="*how much?*"== (e.g. **distance**, **speed**, **time**, and **energy**.).

## Vectors
* These are quantities that are described by a magnitude and direction.
* You are calculating the ==point of origin== and the ==directions== (e.g. **displacement**, **velocity**, **acceleration**, and **force**.).
