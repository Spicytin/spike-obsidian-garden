Around ==13.8 billion years ago==, the universe began with a giant expansion called the **Big Bang**. In the first few minutes after this event, the first elements in the universe were created. 

This process is known as **Big Bang nucleosynthesis**. It is the scientific explanation of ==how the lightest elements in the universe were formed== during the early stage of the universe. These elements are:
* ***Hydrogen*** ($1_H$ and $2_H$ or ***Deuterium***)
* ***Helium*** ($3_He$ and $4_He$)
* ***Lithium*** ($7_Li$)

These were not formed inside stars yet. Instead, they were formed in just the first ==3 to 20 minutes== after the **Big Bang** while the universe was ==extremely hot and dense==.

## The Sequence of Formation


+--------------------------------------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| 1. **First second after the Big Bang**     | * The universe was ==too hot== for **[[Resources-Data/Knowledge/Science/Chemistry/Atoms\|atoms]]** to form.                                           |
|                                            | * Only subatomic particles existed: **[[Resources-Data/Knowledge/Science/Chemistry/Atoms#Main Parts of an Atom\|protons, neutrons, and electrons]]**. |
+--------------------------------------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| 2. **After a few minutes**                 | When the temperature dropped:                                                                             |
|                                            | * **Protons** and **neutrons** combined to form **nuclei** (==nuclear fusion==).                          |
|                                            | * The first simple elements were created.                                                                 |
+--------------------------------------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| 3. **About 20 minutes after the Big Bang** | * The temperature became ==too low== for more fusion.                                                     |
|                                            | * The production of light elements stopped.                                                               |
+--------------------------------------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

Which is why only a small portion of elements formed in the beginning. The heavier ones came from stars much later.
