* **Accuracy** - the closeness of the experimental value to the true value.
* **Precision** - the closeness of measurement from one another.

## Example
Four students performed an experiment to measure the density of aluminum ($2.7 g/mL$). Which data is accurate but not precise?

### Answers
1. **John**
	* 2.9 is not very close to 2.7, so his data is <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">not accurate</mark>.
	* All of his values, each of his trials, is around 2.9, so his numbers are very close to each other. They agree with each other, so his data is <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">precise</mark>.
2. **Sally**
	* Her numbers are very widely, they're not close to 2.7 at all, so her data is <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">not accurate</mark>.
	* Her numbers don't agree and not close with each other, so her data is <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">not precise</mark>.
3. **Megan**
	* Relative to **John** and **Sally**, her data is pretty close to 2.7, so her data is <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">accurate</mark>.
	* Her data jumps around to kind like **Sally**'s; not as extreme as **Sally**'s data but her numbers don't agree with each other. So her data is <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">not precise</mark>.
4. **Mike**
	* His data is definitely <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">accurate</mark>, very close to 2.7.
	* His data is <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">precise</mark>, his numbers are very, very close.
