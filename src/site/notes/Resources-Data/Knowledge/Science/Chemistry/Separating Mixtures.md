Chemist separate mixtures by using different methods:
1. **Filtration** - separating the components of a suspension.
2. **Decantation** - in this process, the solid particles are allowed to settled first at the bottom and later, the liquid which is called **supernatant** is poured into another container leaving behind solid particle.
3. **Evaporation** - converting liquid to gas; useful in sorting mixtures such as salt solution.
4. **Distillation** - separating a homogeneous mixture composed of two substances with different boiling points.
5. **Magnetic Separation** - separating elemental metals from other particles in a mixture.
6. **Melting** - extracting mixture that contain two substances with different melting points.
7. **Sublimation** - changing solid to gas without passing through the liquid state.
8. **Centrifugation** - in this process, the mixture is poured into a special tube in the centrifuge apparatus, and is allowed to spin using centrifugal force. The spinning motion forces the sediments to settle at the bottom. The liquid can be poured off from the solid particles.
