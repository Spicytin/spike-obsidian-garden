**[[Resources-Data/Knowledge/Science/Phase Diagrams\|Phase Diagrams]]** are ==plots of pressure== (usually in atmospheres) versus temperature (usually in degrees Celsius or Kelvin).

## The Three Area
These are marked solid, liquid, and vapor. Under a set of conditions in the diagram, a substance can exist in a solid, liquid, or vapor (gas) phase.

## The Three Lines
The lines that serve as boundaries between physical states represent the ==combinations of pressures and temperatures== at which two phases can exist in equilibrium. In other words, these lines define phase change points.

### Melting (or Freezing) curve
The curve on a phase diagram which represents the ==transition between liquid and solid states==. It shows the effect of pressure on the melting point of solid.

The green line divides the solid and liquid phases, and represents melting (solid to liquid) and freezing (liquid to solid) points. Anywhere on this line, there is equilibrium between the solid and the liquid.

### Vaporization (Condensation Curve)
The curve on a phase diagram which represents the ==transition between gaseous and liquid states==. It shows the effect of pressure on the boiling point of the liquid.

The blue line divides the liquid and gas phases, and represents vaporization (liquid to as) and condensation (gas to liquid) points. Anywhere along this line, there will be equilibrium between the liquid and the vapor.

### Sublimation (or deposition curve)
The curve on a phase diagram which represents the ==transition between gaseous and solid states==. It represents the effect of increased temperature on a solid at a very low constant pressure, lower than the triple point.

The red line divides the solid and gas phases, and represents sublimation (solid to gas) and deposition (gas to solid) points.

## The Two Important Points
### Triple Point
The combination of pressure and temperature at which all three phases of matter are at equilibrium. It is the point on a phase diagram at which the three states of matter coexist. The lines that represent the conditions of solid-liquid, liquid-vapor, and solid-vapor equilibrium meet at the triple point.

### Critical Point
Terminates the liquid/gas phase line. It is the set of temperature and pressure on a phase diagram where the liquid and gaseous phases of a substance merge together into a single phase. Beyond the temperature of the critical point, the merged single phase is known as a **supercritical fluid**.
