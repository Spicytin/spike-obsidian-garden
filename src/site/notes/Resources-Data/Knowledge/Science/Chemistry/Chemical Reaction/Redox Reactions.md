**Chemical reaction** involving the ==transfer of electrons==:
* **Oxidation** $\rightarrow$ loss of **electrons**, increase in oxidation number
* **Reduction** $\rightarrow$ gain of **electrons**, decrease in oxidation number


Every day, **redox reactions** (**reduction**-**oxidation** reactions) happen around us:
* Rusting of iron $\rightarrow$ oxidation of $Fe$ by $O_2$ and $H_2O$
* Photosynthesis $\rightarrow$ $CO_2$ reduced to ***glucose***, $H_2O$ oxidized to $O_2$
* Cellular respiration $\rightarrow$ *glucose* oxidized to ==release energy==.
* Batteries $\rightarrow$ chemical energy is converted into ==electrical energy== through redox.

## Balancing Redox Reactions (Half-Reaction Method)
1. Write separate half-reactions (**oxidation** and **reaction**).
2. Balance **atoms** (except $H$ and $O$).
3. Balance ***oxygen*** by adding $H_2O$.
4. Balance ***hydrogen*** by adding $H^+$ (in acidic) or $OH^-$ (in basic).
5. Balance charges by adding **electrons** ($e^-$).
6. Multiply half-reactions to equalize $e^-$ transferred.
7. Add and cancel common species.
