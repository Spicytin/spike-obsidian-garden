The maximum amount of [[Resources-Data/Knowledge/Science/Chemistry/Solutions/Solution, Solute, and Solvent#Solute\|solute]] that can dissolve in a given amount of solvent at a specific temperature.

**Example**: Sugar dissolves faster in hot water than in cold water because higher temperature increases solubility.

## Key Points
* Solubility depends on temperature.
* Solubility depends on the nature of solute and [[Resources-Data/Knowledge/Science/Chemistry/Solutions/Solution, Solute, and Solvent#Solvent\|solvent]].
* For solids, solubility usually increases with temperature.
* For gases, solubility decreases as temperature increases.
