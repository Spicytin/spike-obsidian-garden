 1. **Write the correct formula**.
	* Make sure all **reactants** and **products** are written with the right **[[Resources-Data/Knowledge/Science/Chemistry/Chemical Formula\|chemical formulas]]**.
	* Do not change **subscripts** (e.g. $H_2O$ cannot become $H_2O_2$ just to balance).
	* Only **coefficients** (whole numbers in front) can be changed.
2. **Count the number of [[Resources-Data/Knowledge/Science/Chemistry/Atoms\|atoms]] on both sides**.
	* Make a list of each **element**
	* Count the number of **atoms** for each **element** on the **reactant** side (left) and the **product** side (right).
3. **Balance one element at a time**.
	* Start with **elements** that appear in only one **[[Resources-Data/Knowledge/Science/Chemistry/Compound\|compound]]** on each side of the equation.
	* Use **coefficients** to adjust the number of **atoms**.
	* Leave ***hydrogen*** ($H$) and ***oxygen*** ($O$) for last (since they usually appear in multiple **compounds**).
4. **Balance polyatomic ions as a unit (if possible)**.
	* If the same **polyatomic ion** (like ${SO_4}^{2-}$, ${NO_3}^{-}$, $OH^-$) appears unchanged on both sides, treat it as one group instead of balancing each **atom** separately.
5. **Use the lowest whole-number coefficients**.
	* Once balanced, make sure all **coefficients** are the smallest possible whole numbers.
	* If you get **fractions**, multiply the entire equation by a common **denominator**.
6. **Double-check your work**.
	* Count **atoms** of each **element** again.
	* Ensure that the number of **atoms** for every **element** is equal on both sides.
