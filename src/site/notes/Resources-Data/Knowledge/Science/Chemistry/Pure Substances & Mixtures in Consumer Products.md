## Household Cleaning Material
1. **Bleach** - helps clean and whiten surfaces by generally lowering the stability of the chemical bonds in stain molecules. It can convert dirt into particles that can be easily washed away in conjunction with use of detergents.
2. **NaOCI** (**Sodium Hypochlorite**) and **H $_2$ O $_2$** (**Hydrogen Peroxide**) - most common bleaching agents that are strong oxidizers; they can burn their skin and eyes, especially if used in concentrated form.
3. **Soap and Detergent** - mixture of surfactants, water softeners, stain removers, enzymes and perfumes, among others. They are generally not toxic and severely dangerous, but may cause irritation to the skin and eyes.
4. **Surfactants** - render soaps and detergents capable of lowering the surface tension of water, which allows them to wet the surface to be cleaned. They also loosen and disperse water-insoluble solids, making them washable with water.
