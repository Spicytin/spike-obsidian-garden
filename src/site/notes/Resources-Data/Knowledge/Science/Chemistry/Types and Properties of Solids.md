Solids can be classified as **crystalline** or **amorphous** based on the arrangement of their particles. Crystalline solids have ==highly regular arrangement of particles==, while amorphous solids have ==considerable disorder== in their structure.

## Amorphous Solids
Amorphous solids, such as glass, are formed rapidly that its constituent particles do not have time to align or organize into a more crystalline lattice.

## Crystalline Solids
Have a well-defined crystal lattice.

> [!note]
> * A **lattice** is a three-dimensional system of points ==designating the positions of the components== (ions, atoms, or molecules) that make up a crystal.
> * A **unit cell** is the smallest repeating unit of lattice.
