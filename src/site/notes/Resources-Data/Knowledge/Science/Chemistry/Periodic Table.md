The **Periodic Table of Elements** is your road map for understanding chemistry. It organizes ==all known elements== by their ==properties, behaviors, and relationships with one another==.

## Early Development of the Periodic Table
***Dimitri Mendeleev*** arranged elements based on **atomic mass**, but some elements appeared out of order when their properties were compared. The discovery of **[[Resources-Data/Knowledge/Science/Chemistry/Atomic Number\|atomic number]]** solved this issue completely.

## Parts of the Periodic Table
Each element is usually shown as a small box that contains:
* **[[Resources-Data/Knowledge/Science/Chemistry/Atomic Number\|Atomic Number]]** - This is the number of **protons** (and **electrons**) in the atom. 
	* e.g. **6** for ***Carbon***
* **Symbol** - A one or two-letter abbreviation 
	* e.g. **C** for ***Carbon***
* **Element Name** 
	* e.g. ***Carbon***
* **Atomic Mass** - The ==weighted average mass for all isotopes== of the element.
	* e.g. **12.01** for ***Carbon***

## How is it organized?
1. **Periods** (**Rows**)
	* **Rows** run from ==left to right==. 
	* There are **7 periods**, and each period corresponds t the ==number of energy levels== (**electron shells**) as the **atom**. 
		* e.g. ***Hydrogen*** and ***Helium*** are in Period 1, so both have just 1 energy level.
2. **Groups or Families** (**Columns**)
	* **Columns** run from ==top to bottom==.
	* There are **18 groups**.
	* **Elements** in the same group share ==similar chemical and physical properties== and have the same number of **valence electrons**.
		* e.g. Group 1 contains the **Alkali Metals**, which are ==very reactive and soft==.

## Major Sections of the Periodic Table

| **Section**           | **Location on Table**       | **Examples**           | **Key Characteristics**                                                   |
| --------------------- | --------------------------- | ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Metals**            | Left and center             | **Fe**, **Na**, **AI** | Shiny, good conductors, malleable, tend to lose electrons (**+**).        |
| **Nonmetals**         | Right side                  | **O**, **N** **CI**    | Generally dull, poor conductors, brittle, tend to gain electrons (**-**). |
| **Metalloids**        | Along the "stair-step" line | **B**, **Si**, **As**  | Exhibit mixed properties of metals and nonmetals.                         |
| **Transition Metals** | Groups 3-12 (center block)  | **Fe**, **Cu**, **Zn** | Variable oxidation states, often form colorful compounds.                 |

## Special Groups


| **Group** | **Name**                  | **Characteristics**                                             |
| --------- | ------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Group 1   | **Alkali Metals**         | Very reactive, soft metals that react vigorously with water.    |
| Group 2   | **Alkaline Earth Metals** | Less reactive than Group 1, still very important in chemistry.  |
| Group 17  | **Halogens**              | Extremely reactive nonmetals that often form salts with metals. |
| Group 18  | **Noble Gases**           | Inert, stable, and have full outer electron shells.             |

## How to Read the Periodic Table
Examine an example element:
![Oxygen](https://media.istockphoto.com/id/1414919225/vector/oxygen-symbol-chemical-element-of-the-periodic-table-vector-illustration.jpg?s=612x612&w=0&k=20&c=lkVGHqVDwvk-SUVIwRq2Tmj-8VIgdUCiGuI0dmi_QfM=)

* **Atomic Number 8**: ***Oxygen*** has **8 protons**, and, in a **neutral atom**, **8 electrons**.
* **Symbol O**: Represents ***Oxygen***
* **Atomic Mass 15.999**: Indicates the ==average mass of the element's isotopes== (approximately **16 atomic mass units**).
