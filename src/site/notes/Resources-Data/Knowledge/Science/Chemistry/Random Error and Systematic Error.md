## Random Error
* The uncertainly (==experimental error==) arises from a scale reading.
* Results affect the ==uncontrolled variables== in the measurement.

## Systematic Error
* May come from a flaw in the equipment used. 
* Also called as **determinate error**

** **
The error that occurs in measurement is often expressed as a percent error. It is computed as follows:

$$\% \text{error} = \frac{\text {Experimental value} - \text{True value}}{\text {True value}} \times 100\% $$

### Examples
1. A chemist is testing the concentration of a salt solution. The label on the bottle **claims** that the solution has a concentration of $5.0 \text{mol/L}$. During testing, the chemist measures the concentration and records a value of $4.8 \text{mol/L}$. To determine how close the measured concentration is to the label's claim, the chemist needs to calculate the percent error.
	1. Plug in the Values:
	   $\% \text{error} = \left| \dfrac{4.8 - 5.0}{5.0} \right| \times 100\%$
	2. Perform the Subtraction:
	   $\% \text{error} = \left| \dfrac{-0.2}{5.0} \right| \times 100\%$
	3. Divide:
	   $\% \text{error} = \left| -0.04 \right| \times 100\%$
	4. Remove the Negative Sign and Absolute Value:
	   $\% \text{error} = 0.04 \times 100\%$
	5. Multiply by 100 to Get the Percentage:
	   $\% \text{error} = 4\%$
2. A physicist is calibrating a new thermometer. The **thermometer's manual** states at room temperature ($25.0^\circ C$), it should read exactly $25.0^\circ C$. However, during the calibration, the physicist records a temperature of $24.5^\circ C$. To determine how accurate the thermometer is, the physicist needs to calculate the percent error.
	1. Plug in the Values:
	   $\% \text{error} = \left| \dfrac{24.5 - 25.0}{25.0} \right| \times 100\%$
	2. Perform the Subtraction:
	   $\% \text{error} = \left| \dfrac{-0.5}{25.0} \right| \times 100\%$
	3. Divide:
	   $\% \text{error} = \left| -0.02 \right| \times 100\%$
	4. Remove the Negative Sign and Absolute Value:
	   $\% \text{error} = 0.02 \times 100\%$
	5. Multiply by 100 to Get the Percentage:
	   $\% \text{error} = 2\%$
3. A scientist is investigating the density of a newly discovered metal. According to the literature, the **true density** of this metal is known to be $8.96 g/cm^3$. The scientist conducts an **experiment** to measure the density and finds that the **experimental value** is $9.10 g/cm^3$. To evaluate the accuracy of the experimental measurement, the scientist needs to calculate the percent error.
	1. Plug in the Values:
	   $\% \text{error} = \left| \dfrac{9.10 - 8.96}{8.96} \right| \times 100\%$
	2. Perform the Subtraction:
	   $\% \text{error} = \left| \dfrac{0.14}{8.96} \right| \times 100\%$
	3. Divide:
	   $\% \text{error} = \left| 0.015 \right| \times 100\%$
	4. Remove the Absolute Value:
 	   $\% \text{error} = 0.015 \times 100\%$
	5. Multiply by 100 to Get the Percentage:
	   $\% \text{error} = 1.5 \%$
