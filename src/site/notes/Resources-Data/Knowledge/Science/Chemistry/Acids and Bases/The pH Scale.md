Measures how acidic or basic a solution is. It ranges from ==0 to 14==.

* pH less than 7 - **Acidic**
* pH equal to 7 - **Neutral**
* pH greater than 7 - **Basic** (alkaline)

The lower the pH value, the stronger the acid. The higher the pH value, the stronger the base.

## Examples

| **Acid**     | **pH Scale** |
| ------------ | ------------ |
| Battery acid | 1            |
| Vinegar      | 3            |
| Pure water   | 7            |
