Arrangement of [[Resources-Data/Knowledge/Science/Chemistry/Atoms#Main Parts of an Atom\|electrons]] in the space around the nucleus of an [[Resources-Data/Knowledge/Science/Chemistry/Atoms\|atom]]. It is also a ==distribution of electrons== in the orbitals of an atom.

## Energy Level (electron shell)
Orbits where ==electrons spin around== the nucleus of an atom.

## Energy Sublevel (subshell)
Energy subdivision of a principal energy level. It is designated by:
* **s** (sharp)
* **p** (principal)
* **d** (diffuse)
* **f** (fundamental)
