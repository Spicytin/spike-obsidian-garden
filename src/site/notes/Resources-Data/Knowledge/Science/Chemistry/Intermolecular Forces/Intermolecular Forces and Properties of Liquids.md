Liquids do not have a simple or regular structure, but many of their properties can be explained qualitatively by viewing them at the particulate level.

## Surface Tension
The ==measure of the elastic force== in the surface of a liquid. It is the amount of energy required to stretch or increase the surface of a liquid by a unit area. It is manifested as some sort of skin on the surface of a liquid or in a drop of liquid.

Surface tension allows needs and paper clips to ==float in water== if placed carefully on the surface. It also explains why drop of water are spherical in shaped. 

These **[[Resources-Data/Knowledge/Science/Chemistry/Intermolecular Forces (IMF)\|intermolecular forces]]** tend to ==pull the molecules into the liquid== and cause the surface to tighten like an elastic film or "*skin*". Molecules within a liquid are ==pulled in all directions== by intermolecular forces. Molecules at the surface are ==pulled downward and sideways== by other molecules, not upward away from the surface. The liquids that have strong intermolecular forces also have ==high surface tension==.

## Capillary Action
Also known as **capillarity**. It is the tendency of a liquid to ==rise in narrow tubes== or be drawn into small openings such as those between grains of a rock. It is also a result of [[Resources-Data/Knowledge/Science/Chemistry/Intermolecular Forces/Intermolecular Forces of Attraction\|intermolecular attraction]] between ==the liquid and solid materials==.

Capillary action is shown by water rising ==spontaneously in capillary tubes==. A thin film of water adheres to the wall of the glass tube as water molecules are ==attracted to atoms== making up the glass ($SiO_2$).

### Types of Capillary Action Forces

| 1. **Cohesion** | The intermolecular attraction ==between like molecules== (the liquid molecules).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
|                 |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
|                 | When the cohesive forces between the liquid molecules are ==greater than the adhesive forces== between the liquid and the walls of the container, the surface of the liquid is **convex**. When the cohesive forces between the liquid molecules are ==lesser than the adhesive forces== between the liquid and the walls of the container, the surface of the liquid is **concave**. |
+-----------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| 2. **Adhesion** | An attraction ==between unlike molecules== (such as those in water and in the particles that make up the glass tube).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

These forces also define the shape of the surface of a liquid in a cylindrical container (the **meniscus**!).

## Viscosity
Defined as the ==resistance of a liquid to flow==. It is loosely referred to as the ==thickness or thinness of a liquid==. Syrup and oil flow more slowly than water and are thus described as ==more viscous==.

The viscosity of liquid depends on their intermolecular attraction. The ==stronger the intermolecular force==, the ==higher is the liquid's viscosity==.

Long-chained substances like **oil** have greater intermolecular forces because there are ==more atoms that can attract one another==, contributing to the substance's total attractive forces. **Honey**, a concentrated solution of sugar, is also ==highly viscous== because of the **[[Resources-Data/Knowledge/Science/Chemistry/Intermolecular Forces/Intermolecular Forces of Attraction#Hydrogen Bonding\|hydrogen bonding]]** that forms as a result of the numerous $OH$ groups of sugar molecule.

## Vapor Pressure
The pressure ==exerted by its vapor== when in equilibrium with liquid or solid. Substances with ==relatively strong intermolecular forces== will have ==low vapor pressure== because the particles will have ==difficulty escaping as a gas==.

## Boiling Point
The temperature at which its vapor pressure is ==equal to the external or atmospheric pressure==.

Increasing the temperature of a liquid ==raises the kinetic energy of its molecules==, until such point where the energy of the particle movement exceeds the intermolecular forces that hold them together. The liquid molecules then transform to gas and are seen as bubbles that rises to the surface of the liquids and escape to the temperature. Then temperature at which a liquid boils under 1 atmospheric pressure ($1 atm$) is referred to as its ==normal boiling point==. At higher altitude, the atmospheric pressure is lower, hence, the boiling point will subsequently decrease.

The ==greater intermolecular force==, the ==higher the energy needed to increase the kinetic energy== of the molecules to break these forces.

## Heat of Vaporization ($\triangle H vap$)
The ==amount of heat required to vaporize one mole of substance== at its boiling point. The application of heat disrupts the intermolecular forces of attraction of the liquid molecules and allows them to vaporize. Boiling point generally increases as molar heat of vaporization increases.

The $\triangle H vap$ is also determined by the ==strength of intermolecular forces== between molecules.
