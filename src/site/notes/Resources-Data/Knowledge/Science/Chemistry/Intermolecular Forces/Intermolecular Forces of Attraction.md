The [[Resources-Data/Knowledge/Science/Chemistry/Intermolecular Forces (IMF)\|intermolecular forces]] of attraction in a pure substance are collectively known as ***van der Waals forces***.

## Dipole-dipole
Exist ==between polar molecules==. One end of a dipole attracts the oppositely charged end of the other dipole.

## Hydrogen Bonding
A special and very strong type of dipole-dipole force that exists between ==a hydrogen atom bound to a small and highly electronegative non-metal atom==. Hydrogen bond occurs in polar molecules containing $H$ and any of highly electronegative **elements**, in particular: ***Nitrogen***, ***Fluorine***, and ***Oxygen***.

## Ion-dipole
Acts between ==an ion and a polar molecule==. This explains the solubility of **[[Resources-Data/Knowledge/Science/Chemistry/Compound#Ionic Compounds\|ionic compounds]]** in water, which is polar molecule.

The ions and the oppositely charged ends of the polar water molecules overcome the attraction between ions themselves. Each of the ions becomes separated, and water molecules cluster around it.

## London Dispersion
The weakest type of intermolecular force, where two non-polar molecules approach each other, an instantaneous dipole moment forms. This force is sometimes called an **induced dipole-induced dipole attraction**.

## Dipole-Induced Dipole
Interaction between ==polar and non-polar molecules==.
