In 1913, **Henry Moseley** discovered that each element has a unique and measurable property: its number of protons, called the **atomic number** (*Z*).

This meant that:
* Atomic number—not **atomic mass**—defines an element.
* When elements were arranged by atomic number, all inconsistencies disappeared.
* Scientists now had a precise and scientific basis for identifying and creating new elements.

## How Atomic Number Led to the Creation of New Elements
Once the identity of an element was known to depend only on its number of [[Resources-Data/Knowledge/Science/Chemistry/Atoms#Main Parts of an Atom atomparts\|protons]], scientists realized that they could change one element into another by altering its nucleus.
