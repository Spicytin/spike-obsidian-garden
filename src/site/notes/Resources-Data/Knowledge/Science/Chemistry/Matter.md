Anything that ==has mass and occupies space==. Everything on Earth has mass and takes up space.

## States of Matter
* **Solid**
* **Liquid**
* **Gas** 
* **Plasma**

| **Properties**                 | **Solids**                        | **Liquids**                             | **Gases**                                |
| ------------------------------ | --------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| **Distance between particles** | Very close together               | Close, but with small gaps              | Far apart                                |
| **Molecular arrangement**      | Tightly packed in a fixed pattern | Random but still close                  | Random and far apart                     |
| **Shape**                      | Definite shape                    | Takes the shape of the container        | No define shape; fills the container     |
| **Volume**                     | Definite volume                   | Definite volume                         | Indefinite volume; expands to fill space |
| **Density**                    | High                              | High                                    | Low                                      |
| **Compressibility**            | Cannot be appreciably compressed  | Cannot be appreciably compressed        | Easy to compress                         |
| **Speed of movement**          | Very slow (vibrating only)        | Moderate                                | Very fast                                |
| **Forces of attraction**       | Very strong                       | Moderate                                | Very weak                                |

1. All matter is made up of ==tiny particles==.
2. These are particles in ==constant motion==.
3. The speed of particle is ==proportional to temperature==. Increased temperature means greater speed.
4. Solids, liquids, and gases differ in distances between particles, in the freedom of motion of particles, and in the extent to which the particles interact.

## Classifications
**Pure Substance** - one material with same composition.

e.g.:
* table sugar
* table salt
* distilled water
* oxygen gas
	**Element** - the simplest form of matter with just one atom.
	**Compound** - two or more atoms.

**Mixture** - two or more substances combined physically. 

e.g.:
* iodized salt
* soft drinks
* brown sugar
* human breath
	**Homogenous** - uniformly distributed (*formula: solute + solvent = solution*)
	e.g. rubbing alcohol, carbonated soft drinks, human breath
	**Heterogenous** - chemically combined
	e.g. water oil, salt and pepper

### Examples of Heterogenous Mixtures
1. **suspension** - sand + water
2. **colloid** - milk (*Tyndall effect*)
