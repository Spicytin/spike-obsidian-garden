* **Line** - ==prolongation of a point, or a mark on a surface==. **Solid lines** can be used in order to define ==form==, while **broken lines** are typically used to suggest ==hidden forms==. **Lines** are also used to suggest ==dimensions==, and to ==guide visual movement==.

* **Shape and Mass** - ==area with boundaries identified or drawn using lines==. A shape may be based on natural or living forms. This shape is called an **organic shape**, and can be ==irregular== or ==rounded==. A shape may also be based on measured forms. This shape, on the other hand, is called a **geometric shape**. In contrast to shape, which is ==two-dimensional==, **mass** refers to ==solid portions of a three-dimensional object==.

* **Color** - visual perception that allows a person to ==differentiate objects== due to the way various wavelengths of light are reflected. **Color** is a very important element because it can ==communicate information and emotion to the viewer==. It has three properties, which are as follows:
	* **Hue** - basic or pure color, and is represented in the **color wheel**.
	* **Value** - lightness and darkness of color. A light color or **tint** is the result of adding white to a hue, while a dark color or **shade** results from adding black to a hue.

	* **Saturation** - brightness and dullness of color. It is also referred to as purity of the color. A bright color can be produced by adding more pigment to the same hue, while a dull color can be produced by adding gray or the color's complement to the pigment.

The **color wheel**, which is an ==arrangement of primary, secondary, and tertiary colors==, is an important tool to identify which colors can work well if used in a certain artwork. Those sets of colors are referred to as **color schemes** or **color relationships**. 

### Color Categories

| **Categories** | **Colors**                                                                       |
| -------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Primary**    | Red, Yellow, and Blue                                                            |
| **Secondary**  | Orange, Purple, and Green                                                        |
| **Tertiary**   | Blue-Green, Blue-Violet, Red-Orange, Red-Violet, Yellow-Orange, and Yellow-Green |

### Color Schemes

| **Scheme**              | **Description**                                                                                                                                                    | **Wheel**                                                                                                      |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Monochromatic**       | Involves using the same hue but with ==different gradients== of value.                                                                                             | ![Monochromatic](https://libapps.s3.amazonaws.com/accounts/164556/images/monochromatic.png)                    |
| **Analogous**           | Entails the use of ==three== or ==four adjacent colors== in the color wheel.                                                                                       | ![Analogous](https://libapps.s3.amazonaws.com/accounts/164556/images/ANALOGOUS_COLORS.png)                     |
| **Complementary**       | Involves the use of a color and its complementâ€”, meaning the color ==located opposite== of the first color.                                                        | ![Comeplemntary](https://libapps.s3.amazonaws.com/accounts/164556/images/Lib_complementarycolors.png)          |
| **Split-complementary** | Close relative to the **complementary** color scheme. But instead of using the color's complement, this scheme uses the ==two colors adjacent== to the complement. | ![Split-complementary](https://libapps.s3.amazonaws.com/accounts/164556/images/SPLIT_COMPLEMENTARY_COLORS.png) |
| **Triadic**             | Uses ==three colors== that are of ==equal distance with each other==.                                                                                              | ![Triadic](https://libapps.s3.amazonaws.com/accounts/164556/images/TRIADIC_COLORS.png)                         |
| **Tetradic**            | Also known as **double complementary color scheme**, this uses ==two pairs== of **complementary colors**.                                                          | ![Tetradic](https://libapps.s3.amazonaws.com/accounts/164556/images/TETRADIC_COLORS.png)                       |

* **Value** - ==lightness or darkness of an area==. This element is evident in ==creating shadows== for a two-dimensional object to give an ==illusion of depth==.
* **Texture** - ==feel or appearance of a surface==. A person may describe **texture** if the surface is either ==smooth== or ==rough==. **Texture** may also be described as ==actual== or ==implied==. **Actual texture** can be ==felt tangibly== based on the material that is used for the artwork. On the other hand, **implied texture** can be ==exhibited==, for instance, in a painting of fur of an animal.
* **Space** - area that is ==occupied by an object or a subject==, as well as the ==area surrounding that object or subject==. An illusion of space can still be created in a two-dimensional surface using **perspective**. There are two types of **perspective**: **atmospheric perspective**, which utilizes the ==properties of light and air== in depicting the ==illusion of distance==; and **linear perspective**, which involves the ==use of vanishing points== and ==receding hidden lines==.

* **Time and Motion** - **Movement** in the visual arts can be either be an **illusion** or an **actual motion**. An **illusion of movement** is more common in two-dimensional artworks. On the other hand, **actual motion** is easily seen in **kinetic sculpture**, a type of sculpture that ==moves with the wind== or are ==vibrating with the surrounding air==.
