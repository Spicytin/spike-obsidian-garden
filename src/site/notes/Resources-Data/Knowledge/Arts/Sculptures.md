The branch of the visual arts that operates in ==three dimensions==. It is one of the ==plastic arts==. Durable sculptural processes originally used ==carving== and ==modelling==; in **stones**, **metals**, **ceramics**, **woods** and other materials but, since Modernism, there has been almost complete freedom of materials and processes.

In contrast to **painting**, **sculpture** has three dimensions - **height**, **width**, and **depth**. It is created by either **carving**, **modelling**, or **assembling** parts together.

## General Kinds of Sculpture
1. **Freestanding** - can ==independently stand in space==. It has a ==flat horizontal base==. All its sides contribute to the overall form of the structure.
2. **Relief** - does not have a flat horizontal base. The form is ==projected from a flat surface==. There are two types of relief - **low relief** or **base-relief** which is ==slightly from the flat surface==, and **high relief**. *Cagayan De Oro's Legendary River Monster* is an example of **relief sculpture**.
3. **Assemblage** - formed by ==putting together materials== such as **found objects**, **pieces of paper**, **sponges**, **wood scraps**, and other materials. A good example of this is *Lamberto Hechanova's Man and Woman*.
4. **Kinetic sculpture** - considered as a ==sculpture in motion== because the entire sculpture or some parts of the sculpture are ==moving with the wind== or are ==vibrating with the surrounding air==.
5. **Welded sculpture** - involve the process of ==connecting sheets of metal together== by using an **acetylene** or **electric torch**.
6. **Use of glass** - where the medium of expression used by the artist is **glass**.
7. **Symbolic sculpture** - in which an ==abstract idea== is represented by means of ==allegory== and ==personification==.
