Refers to a ==sequence of moving pictures==, which is typically shown on television or in a cinema. **Filmmaking** became an industry in the Philippines during the 1950s. However, the 1970s was considered to be a remarkable era in the history of cinema in the Philippines. During this decade, the academe started to produce a new breed of filmmakers, thanks to the increasing number of Philippine school offering mass communication. It was also during this time when the intellectuals were attracted to Filipino films partly because of the influence of the nationalist movement in searching for that unique Filipino identity for film. Foreign audiences in international film festivals also started to show interest in Filipino films.

Some of these filmmakers were educated on art films that were created outside the constraints of commercial filmmaking. These filmmakers, called **alternative filmmakers**, started producing ==highly critical and imaginative works==. These alternative films include **animations**, **traditional documentaries**, **docudramas**, **experimental films**, **mixed media**, **short features**, and many others. However, these films were usually shown in schools, international film festivals, and outreach programs organized by some institutions.

The subject of films shifted to ==social commentaries during the dictatorship== in the 1980s. On the other hand, the 1990s was marked with the ==persistence of mainstream formats and imitations==. There were also stereotypical tendencies in creating films for specific audiences. For instance, **melodramas** were continued to be produced in order to cater to the ==female population==, while **action films** were crated for ==male patronage==.

## Elements of Film
### Time
This is considered as the most significant element of cinema. It has three aspects:
* **Physical Time** - refers to ==time for an action to take place== as it is being filmed and projected on the screen. This can be altered through **accelerated motion**, **slow motion**, **stopped motion** and **reverse motion**.
* **Psychological Time** - refers to the impression of the viewer on ==how long does it take for a certain action to take place== and ==how he or she feels== when watching that particular action. For instance, a viewer feels excited when watching fast action scenes.
* **Dramatic Time** - signifies the ==timeline of events== portrayed in the film.
### Space
Just like in a painting or a photograph, a film, when projected on the screen has ==two dimensions==. However, the viewer is ale to perceive space because of the following aspects of space:
* **Scale** - indicates the ==size of the objects== on the screen and how these objects ==relate with the area== surrounding them. It may also involve where the camera is positioned in taking the shot. For example, when camera is situated very far from the object, an expansive view on a small scale is produced. In this case, the viewer will be able to take note of the relationship between the objects showed in the film.
* **Shooting angle** - ==denotes the location or angle== from where the camera records the scene. Shots may be taken with the camera directed vertically downwards, vertically upwards, or horizontally. Each position or angle will have a different effect on the scene that is being recorded.
* **Lighting** - the position of lights can affect how the illusion of depth is created on the film. The relationship of light and dark on the object can give that illusion of depth to the object.
### Sound
Aside from **dialogue**, **sound** also includes **background music**, **theme melodies**, and **silence**.

## Techniques of Cinema
### Cutting/Editing
Involves ==joining one shot with another==, making sure that these two shot are ==logically connected==. This helps in ensuring that only the scenes that are required in the story will be shown. **Transitions** are used for ==emphasis== or for ==smooth changing of one shot to another==, such as **dissolve**, **fade**, and **turn-over**.

### Camera Movement
Done in order to have a ==smoother change of view==, to help in ==gradual growth of emotions==, or to ==simulate a familiar experience==.

### Framing
Helps in ==bringing balance to the film== as it is being viewed. **Framing** can also get the attention of the audience, and sustain that attention.

## Forms and Types of Film
### Aksyon (*Action*)
An American-influenced type of film that mainly uses ==physical conflict== as emphasis. There are two types of **action films**. First one is ==based on real-life stories== or actual experiences of real persons. An example of this is ***Nardong Putik*** (*1972*) which starred *Ramon Revilla Sr*. The other type of **action films**, which is centered on ==purely fictional events==, may be based from the ==tradition of metrical romance== or of the **literary komedya**, or with ==contemporary issues==. 

### Animation
Involves creating ==illustrations== or ==inanimate objects== and bringing them to life. **Single-frame photography** was used to capture images of a ==series of arranged drawings==. These shots are then run in the movie projector on ==10== or ==24 frames per second==. There are three types of **animation**:


| **Type**                 | **Description**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| ------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Drawn animation**      | Involves the ==use of drawings== for a certain image. In this type of **animation**, a single movement requires creating another image on a separate sheet of **celluloid** (***cel***) or **acetate sheet**. **Acrylic colors** are used in creating drawings on **cel** or **acetate**.                                                                                   |
| **Cut-out animation**    | Involves ==cutting out images== from photos, cardboard, or other flat materials. A **collage** is formed out of these materials. This process is simpler, relatively cheaper and does not take too much time. However, this is not popular among filmmakers because the final output does not have the ==smooth flow of movement== compared to that in **drawn animation**. |
| **Model/live animation** | Involves moving ==three-dimensional objects== made from **sand**, **clay**, **wire**, or other solid objects. These movements are recorded by camera.                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

### Dokyu (*Documentary*)

This movie, however, centers on a ==fictional extended family of a sugar baron==.
