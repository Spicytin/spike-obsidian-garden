Everybody goes through each day faced with constraints or limitations: motorists complain of high gasoline prices, times when people suffer because of a shortage of chicken within the market, or insufficient allowance for a student who has to buy books and faculty supplies. People always complain about not having enough-not enough food on the table, not enough money to pay one's debts, or not enough income to fulfill all the family's needs.

With this, we can say that there is an existing **scarcity** and there is insufficiency to satisfy the requirements of consumers and insufficiency of resources for producers that hamper enough protection of products and services. And that is the reason why we have to practice economics.

**Economics** is a branch of ==social science== with the use of limited resources to meet boundless desires (***Rabanal***, *2018*).

The desire to have as ==many goods and services== as possible is a part of human behavior. Consumer's salary and purchasing power, however, limit their ability to purchase goods and services. As a result, consumers must conduct **economics** in this setting (***Introduction to Economics***, n.d.).

Because **economics** is derived from the ancient Greek wood ***oikonomia***, which means ==family or household management== (***Top 4 Definitions of Economics***, n.d.) ***Alfred Marshall***, a well-known economist, defined **economics** as a ==study of humans engaged in everyday activities==.

> *It investigates part of the individual and social activity that is most intimately related to the acquisition and use of material requisites of well-being.*

Because of the presence of **scarcity**, there's a necessity for man, to create decisions in choosing a way to maximize the utilization of scarce resources to satisfy as many needs as possible. As an example, a worker who includes a monthly budget must choose the way to utilize it to pay the rent, buy food, and buy new clothes. If his budget isn't enough, then the worker needs to hand over a number of this stuff. If he decides to not buy new clothes this year, then this is the choice to give up.

The social science of **economics** is described as the ==study of the production, distribution, and consumption of goods and services== (***The Nature and Scope of Economics***, *2018*).

Economic studies became one of the most important subjects of recent times as it evolved over the nineteenth century. **Economics** plays a critical part in the smooth operation of both a small store and a country. Without the use of economic principles, no business can thrive. The field of **economics** is vast and diverse. The interaction of economic agents and the way **economics** run are central to the nature and scope of economics.

## Nature of Economics
The topic of whether economics belongs in the realm of science or the arts is addressed in the nature of economics. Several economists have argued in favor of science, while others have qualms about the arts.

**Economics** is treated as a social science because of the following features (***The Nature and Scope of Economics***, *2018*):
* It involves a systematized collection of ==facts and figures==.
* It is based on the formulation of ==theories and laws==.
* It deals with the ==cause-and-effect relationship==.
These characteristics that demonstrate the nature of **economics** is linked to ==science==. Various economic theories are built on ==logical reasoning==, and real-life scenarios are utilized to develop models on which assumptions are made, much as they are in science.

The foundation of economic theory is the evaluation of ==human interactions== in terms of desires, decision-making, and constraints. Because of the complexity of human motivation and systems, assumptions have been established that serve as the foundation for consumer and company behavior theories, which are both used to simulate circular flow interactions within the economy.

**Economics** provides a simple foundation for comprehending the complexity of the world's relationships. The circular flow picture in Task 4 Figure 1 by Irconomics 2008, for example, depicts the economic framework associated to the dynamic interconnection of economic agents. The circular flow is limited to households and businesses in the figure above, while some renderings include the government and foreign trading partners.

In the case of consumer and corporate behavior, **economics** gives sophisticated frameworks for analyzing ==complicated social interactions==. Representatives who grasp how salaries and consumption move between consumers and producers are better able to understand the relationship's symbiosis rather than focusing on the controversial elements that surface from time to time.

Individuals can become better decision-makers in their own lives and maintain a balance with respect to an externality that has the ability to supplement or hinder their ambitions by having a grasp of the foundations of **economics**. Knowing the basics of **economics** allows an individual to be an ==active and informed participant== instead of a passive economic agent, as economic theories serve as a foundation for ==decision-making and regulatory policy==.

**Economics** is a ==social science== that studies the relationship between the ==production and consumption of commodities and services== in a finite resource environment. The discipline focuses on how economic agents behave or interact both individually (***[[Resources-Data/Knowledge/Economics/Scope of Economics#Microeconomics\|microeconomics]]***) and collectively aggregate (***[[Resources-Data/Knowledge/Economics/Scope of Economics#Microeconomics\|macroeconomics]]***).
