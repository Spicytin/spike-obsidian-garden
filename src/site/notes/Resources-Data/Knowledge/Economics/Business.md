A **business** is just a ==small portion of an industry==. It is an undertaking by a person, or a group of persons who are partners, or **stockholders** who own a juridical entity known as **[[Resources-Data/Knowledge/Economics/Applied Economics/Principles, Tools and Techniques#^corporation\|corporation]]**. Its main objective is to ==earn profit for the owners==. An **industry**, on the other hand, is the ==aggregation of the different businesses== engaged in the same line of the undertaking and serving the same group of buyers. For example, ***Celine Shoes*** in the Philippines is a **business firm** that is a part of the country's shoe industry.

For a person to form a **business**, an industry analysis must be made first. Commonly used is a system known as the ***SWOT analysis***, which ==evaluates the competitive position of the business== based on its strengths and weaknesses, as well as the opportunities and threats facing the business.
