The scope of [[Resources-Data/Knowledge/Economics/Economics\|economics]] is divided into two categories: **microeconomics** and **macroeconomics** (***The Investopedia Team***, *2021*).

### Microeconomics
It studies the behavior of ==individual market participants== such as consumers, producers, and resource owners, as well as corporations. It is more concerned with the flow of commodities from the business to the consumer, as well as the movement of resources from the resource owner to the business. It also deals with the process of ==determining the price of commodities==, commonly known as **Price Theory**.

### Macroeconomics
It examines ==individual economic activity, industries, and their interaction==. It is a branch of **economics** that studies the ==whole economy and the issues== that affect it. **Unemployment**, **inflation**, **economic growth**, and **monetary** and **fiscal policy** are the main focal areas. **Macroeconomics** is concerned with the ==nature of economic growth==, as well as the extension of productive capacity and national income. It is also the study of an ==entire economy==.

It has the following characteristics:

* **[[Resources-Data/Knowledge/Economics/Applied Economics/Demand and Supply/Elasticity/Elasticity\|Elasticity]]** - ==the ratio of change in the percentage== of one variable to another is determined by **elasticity**. For example, **[[Resources-Data/Knowledge/Economics/Applied Economics/Demand and Supply/Elasticity/Demand Elasticity/Demand Elasticity\|Demand Elasticity]]** of income, **demand elasticity** of price, **demand elasticity** of supply, and so on.
* **Theory of Production** - entails the conversion of ==inputs into outputs== in a cost-effective manner. **Packaging**, **shipping**, **storage**, and **manufacturing** are only a few examples.
* **Cost of Production** - evaluates the ==object price== based on the ==cost of resources==.
* **Monopoly** - in this theory, the dominance of a single entity in a certain field is ==investigated==.
* **Oligopoly** - market domination of tiny businesses.

**Macroeconomics** discusses broad aggregates and their interactions from the top down:
* **Growth** - investigates the elements that contribute to ==economic growth==, such as an increase in a country's output per capita through time.
* **Business Cycle** - argues for the central bank and the government to collaborate in formulating ==monetary and fiscal policies== to track output throughout the **business cycle**.
* **Unemployment** - the **unemployment** rate is used to calculate it. It is caused by a number of variables, including ==pay increases, a shortage of job openings==, and so forth.
* **Inflation and Deflation** - these indicators are useful for assessing the state of a country's economy.
	* **Inflation** - an ==increase== in a commodity's price.
	* **Deflation** - a ==reduction== in a commodity's price.
