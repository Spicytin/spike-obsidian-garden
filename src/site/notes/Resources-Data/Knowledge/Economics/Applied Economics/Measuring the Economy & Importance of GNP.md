A way to measure economic growth is to account **Gross Domestic Product** (***GDP***) and **Gross National Product** (***GNP***).

**Gross Domestic Product** (***GDP***) is the ==value of a nation's finished domestic goods and services== during a specific time period, while the **Gross National Product** (***GNP***) is the ==value of all finished goods and services== owned by a country (*Seth, 2021*)

From the standpoint of what the economy has been, every government aims for a stronger economy. The future of the economy is being shaped through shifting past and current perspectives into the future. Looking ahead, in particular, is based on the economy's past and present performance and health. **Production** is at the ==center of the economy==, and its value reflects both resource input and human output.

## How to Calculate the Gross National Product?

According to *Corporate Finance Institute*,
> **Personal consumption expenditures**,
> **government expenditures**, **private domestic investments**, **net exports**, and all income made by
> residents in foreign countries, minus income gained by foreign residents within the domestic
> economy, are all added together to compute ***GNP.*** The value of imports is subtracted from the
> value of the country's exports to determine **net exports**.

Unlike **Gross Domestic Product** (***GDP***), which measures the value of goods and services based on ==where they were produced==, **Gross National Product** measures the value of goods and services based on ==where they were owned==. It is calculated as the value of a country's ***GDP*** plus any income earned by citizens from overseas investments, minus income earned by foreign students inside the country. Because these entries are included in the value of the final products and services, ***GNP*** eliminates the value of any intermediary commodities to avoid double counting.

### Formula

$$Y = C + I + G + (X-M)$$

Where:
$C$ - **Consumption Expenditure**
$I$ - **Investment**
$G$ - **Government Expenditure**
$M$ - **Imports** (**Value of imports** minus **value of exports**)
$X$ - **Net Income** (**Net income** inflow from abroad minus **net outflow** to foreign countries)

Alternatively, the **Gross National Product** can also be calculated as follows:
$$GNP = GDP + Net Income Inflow from Overseas - Net Income Outflow to Foreign Countries$$
Where:
$$GDP = Consumption + Investment + Government Expenditure + Exports - Imports$$
