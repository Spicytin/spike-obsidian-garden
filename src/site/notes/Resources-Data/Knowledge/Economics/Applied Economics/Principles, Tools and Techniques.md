## Business Organization
From a legal point of view, there are four ways to form a **[[Resources-Data/Knowledge/Economics/Business\|business]]**:
1. **Sole Proprietorship** - generally the ==simplest way to set up a business==. It is owned by an individual who is ==singly responsible for running the business== and is ==accountable for all debts and obligations== related to the business. The **sole proprietor** enjoys ==exclusive control and decision-making== and gets all the profits earned, but he/she also shoulders all losses and has ==unlimited liability==, which means payment of his/her loans will extend to his/her personal assets.
2. **Partnership** - an agreement in which two or more persons ==combine their resources== in a **business** to make a profit. A **partnership** agreement is drawn up, and profits are divided among the partners according to the terms of the agreement. There are two types of partnerships:
	* **The General Partnership** - All owners ==share the management of the business==, and each is personally responsible for and must assume the consequences of the actions of the other partners. All general partners have ==unlimited liability==, which means loan payments will extend to their personal property.
	* **The Limited Partnership** - Some members are general partners who control and manage the business and may be entitled to a greater share of the profit. Other partners only ==contribute capital== and take no part in the control and management of the partnership and are liable for debts only to some extent.
3. **Corporation** - a legal entity that is separate from its owners — the **shareholders**. No **shareholder** is personally liable for the debts, obligations, or acts of the **corporation**. Directors and officers can bear liability for their involvement with the **corporation**. The legal entity of the **corporation** gives it an ==individual identity of its own==. **Corporations** can normally exist for a life of ==50 years==, which is renewable for another 50 years. Owners have ==limited liabilities==. However, **corporations** are burdened by ==heavy taxes==.

4. **Cooperative** - an entity organized by people with similar needs to provide themselves with ==good or services== or to ==jointly use available resources== for better and cheaper access to, say, ==income opportunities==.
   
   **Cooperative** members have an equal say in decision-making with ==one vote per member== regardless of the number of shares held. Membership is ==open and voluntary==, and surplus earning is returned to the members according to the amount of their patronage.

## Small, Medium, and Large-scale Businesses
It is also important to study the classification of a **business** by size based on the ==worth of the business' assets==. In the Philippines, **small- and mid-size enterprises** (***SME***s) are enterprises who have an employee size of ==10 to 199 workers== and/or own assets worth ==₱3 million to ₱100 million==.

Any form of the **business organization** must be registered with the appropriate government agencies in the case of **sole proprietorships** and **partnerships**, 100% must be ==owned and capitalized by Filipinos==. For **corporations**, at least 60% of the outstanding capital stocks must be ==owned by Filipino citizens==, and the remaining 40% can be ==owned by foreigners==. **Business** activity must be within the major sector of **industry**, **services**, practice of the profession, operation of **tourism-related businesses**, and **agribusiness**.

The choice of the form of **business organization** may be a ==personal preference of the owner(s)==, based on **objectives**, **available resources**, and **scope of operations**.
