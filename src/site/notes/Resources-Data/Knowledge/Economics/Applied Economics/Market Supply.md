When economists discuss **supply**, they are referring to the ==number of goods or services that a producer is willing to provide at a price==. The price is the amount received by the producer for selling one unit of a good or service. Almost often, ==a price increase leads to an increase in the quantity given, while a decrease in price will decrease the quantity supplied==.

## Supply
The ==number of quantities of the product and services== that is offered for sale at all possible prices in the market in a given period of time and place. **Supply** implies the ability and willingness of sellers to sell.

### Factors of Affecting Supply
According to ***Gabas*** (*2020*), the factors affecting supplies are:
1. **Technology** - the method of production or how something is produced. Having modern technology means being able to produce more. Manufacturing is the reason that you're able to use many of the product as well as enjoy the services that you do today. However, the introduction of technology into the manufacturing industry has helped take it to an entirely new level. Not only has it made it more interesting in terms of innovation, but it has also enabled quicker and more efficient ways in operating. ==Better technology means more supply produced and less cost of producing these goods==.
2. **Cost of production** - The things a producer has to spend on to keep making goods and services. These are: **raw materials**, **labor**, and **factory overhead**. An increase in production cost makes it harder for the producer because he/she has to pay more to keep producing. This is why ==when the cost of producing goes up, the supply of goods most likely goes down==. ==When the cost of production cost goes up the supply goes down, and when the production goes down the supply goes up==.
3. **Number of sellers** - ==more sellers or more factors in a market means an increase in supply and fewer sellers in a market decreases supply==.
4. **Taxes and subsidies** - certain taxes increase the cost of production. Higher taxes ==discourage production== because it ==reduces the earnings of businessmen==, thus government extends tax exemptions to some and necessary industries to stimulate their growth. Similarly, tax incentives are granted to foreign investors in order to increase foreign investment in the Philippines, thus resulting more goods. **Subsidies** offered by the government ==reduces the cost of production, which induces businessmen to produce more==.

### The Law of Supply
It states that ==when the price goes up, the supply goes up, and when the price goes down, the supply goes down==, in which quantity offered for sale will vary directly with price.

### The Supply Curve

The **supply curve** is a graph that depicts a ==direct or positive relationship== between the price of a commodity and the amount of output that a seller is willing to supply at a given point in time, all other factors being equal. The **supply curve** depicts a ==positive or direct link== between the commodity's price and the quantity available in the market.

### Quantity Supplied
It denotes the number of units of a product that a company is willing and able to sell at a specific price during a specific time period.

A **supply schedule** is a table that shows how much of a product will be supplied at various prices by different firms.

| **Price** (per kilo, ₱) | **Quantity Supplied** (Kilos per month) |
| ----------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| 30                      | 0                                       |
| 26.25                   | 150                                     |
| 33.75                   | 300                                     |
| 45                      | 450                                     |
