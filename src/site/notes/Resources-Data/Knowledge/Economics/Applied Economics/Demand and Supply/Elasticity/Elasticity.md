A measure of ==how strong [[Resources-Data/Knowledge/Economics/Applied Economics/Demand and Supply/Market Demand#Demand\|demand]] and [[Resources-Data/Knowledge/Economics/Applied Economics/Demand and Supply/Market Supply#Supply\|supply]] respond== to changes in their determinants, which shape market conditions

The **coefficient of elasticity** is the number obtained when the percent change in demand is divided by the percent change in their determinant.

In terms of how responsive demand and supply are, degrees of **elasticity** may either be:
* **<mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">Elastic</mark>** - A change in a determinant will lead to a proportionately <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">greater change</mark> in demand or supply. The **coefficient of elasticity** is <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">greater than 1</mark>.
* **<mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">Inelastic</mark>** - A change in a determinant will lead to a proportionately <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">lesser change</mark> in demand or supply. The **coefficient of elasticity** is <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">less than 1</mark>.
* **<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">Unitary Elastic</mark>** - A change in a determinant will lead to a proportionately <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">equal change</mark> in demand or supply. The **coefficient of elasticity** is <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">equal to 1</mark>.
