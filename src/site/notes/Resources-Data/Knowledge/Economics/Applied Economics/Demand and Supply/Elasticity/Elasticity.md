A measure of ==how strong demand and supply respond== to changes in their determinants, which shape market conditions

The **coefficient of elasticity** is the number obtained when the percent change in demand is divided by the percent change in their determinant.

In terms of how responsive demand and supply are, degrees of **elasticity** may either be:
* **Elastic** - A change in a determinant will lead to a proportionately ==greater change== in demand or supply. The **coefficient of elasticity** is ==greater than 1==.
* **Inelastic** - A change in a determinant will lead to a proportionately ==lesser change== in demand or supply. The **coefficient of elasticity** is ==less than 1==.
* **Unitary Elastic** - A change in a determinant will lead to a proportionately ==equal change== in demand or supply. The **coefficient of supply** is ==equal to 1==.
