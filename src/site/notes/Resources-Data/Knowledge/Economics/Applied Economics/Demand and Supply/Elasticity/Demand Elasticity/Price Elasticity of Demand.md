## Measurement and Meaning
This measures the responsiveness of the ==product's quantity demanded to a change== in its price. The concept of **[[Resources-Data/Knowledge/Economics/Applied Economics/Demand and Supply/Elasticity/Elasticity\|Elasticity]]** is measured in percentage changes. The value of **price elasticity** may be measured in two ways:

### 1. Arc Elasticity
The value of **elasticity** is computed by ==choosing two points on the demand curve and comparing the percentage changes in the quantities and the price on those two points==. The computation of **arc elasticity** makes use of the following equation:

$$
Ep = \dfrac{\% \triangle Q}{\% \triangle P}
$$

Expanding the equation:

$$
Ep = \frac{Q2 - Q1}{Q2 + Q1}
$$
