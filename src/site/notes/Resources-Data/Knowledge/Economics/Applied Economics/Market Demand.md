The demand for a product and who wants to buy it is referred to as **market demand**. This is determined by how eager customers are to pay a specific price for a product or service. Price rises in tandem with market demand. ==When market falls, the price will fall as well==.

## Demand
An economic principle referring to a customer's desire to purchase goods and services and willingness to pay a price for a specific good or service (***The Investopedia Team***, *2021*).

**Demand** tells us ==what people want==. It also tells us what they can buy at a certain time and place because it involves buying and at what price people can buy it or are willing to buy it.

### Factors of Affecting Demand
According to *Econport n.d.*:

 > *Even though the focus in economics is on the relationship between the price of a product and how much consumers are willing and able to buy, it is important to examine all of the factors that affect the demand for a good or service.*
 
 These factors include:
 1. **Price of a Product** - the price of a product and the amount of product that consumers are willing and able to buy have an ==inverse relationship==. Consumers prefer to buy more of a low-cost goods and less of a high-cost product.
 2. **Changes in Income** - people's earnings have an impact on how much or how little they buy. A factory worker, for example, makes ₱15,000.00 per month, while a businessman earns ₱40,000.00. This means that a factory worker has less money and can only buy a fraction of what a businessman can. When a factory worker's pay rises, he can afford to buy more. The **demand** for goods and services changes in response to **changes in income**. As a result, ==as income rises, consumers buy more, and as income falls, consumers buy less==.
 3. **Changes in the Number of Buyers** - ==more people equals more demand for products and services, while fewer people equals less demand==. For example, during the school year, a pizza restaurant near a university will have increased demand and consequently higher sales during class days. However during the summer, when fewer students are in school, the demand for pizza reduces as the number of customers in the vicinity decreases.
 4. **Tastes and Preferences** - ==when individuals enjoy or prefer a product or service, a demand rises==. Advertisement and fashion have a ==big influence== on these interests and inclinations. There are numerous factors that might alter one's tastes and inclinations, causing people to purchase. For instance, if a celebrity supports a new product it might influence the people to like and want it, thereby ==increasing the demand for a product==.
 5. **Price of Related Goods** - people tend to buy substitute products, when the price of a certain good increases. **Ayungon rice 128** and **Masipag**, for example, are substitute products for some people. If the price of **Masipag** rises, **Ayoung rice 128** may become more appealing. When two items are replacements, the price of one good and the demand for the other good have a ==positive connection==.

### The Law of Demand
==When a product's price falls, consumers buy more of it, and when it rises, they buy less==. According to the **law of demand**, ==as the price of a commodity rises, demand falls, and when the price of a commodity falls, demand rises==.

### The Demand Curve
A schedule of the willingness and capacity of a consumer to buy a commodity at alternative prices at a given point in time, other things held constant. The **demand curve** focuses on the relationship between ==the quantity and the price of the commodity== at a given point in time, other things held constant. The **demand curve** shows a ==negative relationship== between ==the price of the goods and the quantity demand==. Specifically, ==as the price of a commodity decreases, the quantity demand increases, and when the price increases, the quantity demand decreases==.

### Quantity Demanded
The amount (number of units) of a product that a household would buy in a given time period if it could buy it all wanted at the current marketplace.

A **demand schedule** is a table showing how much of a given product a household would be willing to buy a different price. **Demand curves** are usually derived from **demand schedules**.

#### Example: Nina's Demand Schedule for Telephone Calls

| **Price** (₱ per call) | **Quantity Demanded** (Calls per month) |
| ---------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| 0                      | 30                                      |
| 0.50                   | 25                                      |
| 3.50                   | 7                                       |
| 7.00                   | 3                                       |
| 10.00                  | 1                                       |
| 15.00                  | 0                                       |
