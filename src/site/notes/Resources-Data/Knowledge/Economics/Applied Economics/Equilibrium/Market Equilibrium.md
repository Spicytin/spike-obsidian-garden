Economists use the term **equilibrium** to describe the ==balance between supply and demand== in the marketplace. Under ideal market conditions, price tends to settle within a stable range when output satisfies customer demand for that good or service.

The term "***market equilibrium***" refers to a state of **equilibrium** in which ==the amount demanded equals the quantity supplied==. The general agreement of the buyer and seller in the exchange of goods and services at a specific quantity is known as **market equilibrium**. At the point of **equilibrium**, there are always two sides to the narrative, the buyer's and the seller's. On the other hand, when buyers and sellers transact in a market they agree on the price of the commodity and the amount to be sold and bought, this agreed price is called **equilibrium price**

For instance, given the price of ₱30.00 the buyer is willing to purchase 150 units. On the other hand, the seller is willing to sell the quantity of 150 units at a price of ₱30.00. This simple illustration simply shows that the buyer and seller agree at a particular price and quantity that is ₱30.00 and 150 units. This is the main concept of **equilibrium**, that there is a balance between price and quantity of goods bought by consumers and sold by sellers in the market.

#### Demand and Supply Schedule Indicating the Equilibrium Price and Equilibrium Quantity

| **Price** (₱) | **Quantity Demanded** | **Quantity Supplied** |
| ------------- | --------------------- | --------------------- |
| 10            | 250                   | 50                    |
| 20            | 200                   | 100                   |
| 30            | 150                   | 150                   |
| 40            | 100                   | 200                   |
| 50            | 50                    | 250                   |

The intersection of the market supply and demand curves is where a **market's equilibrium** price and quantity are found. The **equilibrium price** in the example above is ₱30.00, with a quantity demanded and supplied of 150 units.

##### What happens when there is market disequilibrium?
When there is **market disequilibrium**, two conditions may happen: there is a **surplus** or either a **shortage** as shown in the example above.

* **Surplus** - a market condition in which the quantity supplied ==exceeds the amount required==; when there is **surplus**, sellers are more likely to cut market prices in order to quickly dispose of products and services.
* **Shortage** - a market condition in which the quantity requested ==exceeds the quantity available at a given price==. A **shortage** occurs when the quantity required is greater than the quantity available.
