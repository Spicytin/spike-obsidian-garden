It helps readers ==understand, remember, and enjoy== what they read. It also improves ==comprehension, stay focused, and make reading more enjoyable==.

## Strategies
### Previewing
* **Definition**: ==looking over the text== before you read it ==completely==.
* **What to look at**:
	* **Title**
	* **Headings** and **subheadings**
	* **Bold** or **italic words**
	* **Pictures** and **captions**
	* **Introduction** or **summary**
* **Example**:
  Before reading an article titled "***The Water Cycle***", scan the pictures, headings like "*Evaporation*" and "*Condensation*", and captions to guess what the article is about.

### Activating Prior Knowledge
* **Definition**: ==connecting what you already know== to the new information in the text.
* **How to do it**:
  Ask yourself:
	  * What do I already know about this topic?
	  * Have I experienced or read something similar before?
* **Example**:
  Before reading a story about **space travel**, think about what you've learned in science or seen in movies like ***Interstellar*** or ***WALL-E***

### Making Predictions
* **Definition**: ==guessing what might happen next== in a story or what the text might be about.
* **Why predict?**: It keeps you interested and thinking while you read.
* **How to predict**: Use ==clues== from the text like **titles**, **pictures**, or what's already happened.
* **Example**:
  If a **mystery story** says, "*He opened the creaky door and gasped*", you might predict: *He found something shocking inside!*

### Predictions based on Schema
* **Definition**: Using your ==background knowledge and experience== (**Schema**) to make ==better predictions==.
* **How to use Schema**:
  Ask yourself:
	  * What usually happens in this kind of situation?
	  * Have I seen or read something similar before?
* **Example**:
  If you read: "*He put on his helmet and heard the roar of the crowd*", you might predict: *He's about to start a bike or car race*, because your **schema** tells you helmets and crowds relate to sports or racing.

### Visualizing
* **Definition**: creating **pictures** or **movies** in your mind based on the ==words you read==.
* **Why visualize?**: it makes the story or information more vivid and easier to remember.
* **Tips to visualize**:
	* Pay attention to **descriptive words**
	* Imagine the **sights**, **sounds**, **smells**, and **feelings**
* **Example**:
  "*The sun sank behind the mountains, painting the sky with orange and purple streaks.*" - A sunset scene.

### Understanding Sequence of Events
* **Definition**: ==recognizing the order== in which things happen.
* **Why it matters**: it helps you understand how the story develops and what causes what.
* **Clue words**: **First**, **next**, **then**, **finally**, **later**, **before**, and **after**
* **Examples**:
 1.  In a recipe, following the steps in the correct sequence ensures success. 
 2. In a story, knowing what happened first helps explain why characters act a certain way later.

### Paraphrasing
* **Definition**: putting information from a text into your own words without ==changing the meaning==.
* **Why paraphrase??**:
	* To check your understanding
	* To explain it to others
	* To avoid copying directly
