A **sense verb** is a verb that describes one of the five senses: sight, hearing, smell, touch, and taste. Verbs such as _look, seem, taste, feel, smell,_ and _sound_ are sensory (sense) verbs. In English, it is important to use adjectives rather than adverbs with sense verbs.

The rules of grammar usually require verbs to be modified by adverbs.

<mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Ethan crossed the street quickly.</mark>

However, sense verbs should be modified by adjectives to sound right.

<mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">Even from a distance, Ethan’s pace looked quickly.</mark>

<mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Even from a distance, Ethan’s pace looked quick.</mark>

To native speakers of English, the impulse to pair sensory verbs with adjectives is instinctive; adverbs sound completely wrong in their place.

<mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">The cookies smelled delicious.</mark>

<mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">The cookies smelled deliciously.</mark>

To use an adverb here makes it sound as if the cookies themselves are sentient beings capable of smelling. The difference is particularly striking with the adjective _good_ and the corresponding adverb, _well_.

<mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">This fabric feels so well on the skin.</mark>

<mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">This fabric feels so good on the skin.</mark>

If you replace _feels_ with another verb, _well_ sounds perfectly reasonable.

<mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">This fabric drapes so well over my shoulders.</mark>

When you are describing the manner in which someone senses something, however, you should use an adverb.
