**Sports**, you either love them or you were the person who hide in the locker room during P.E. class. **Individual sports** are sports in which one athlete ==competes on their own==. Other sports are **dual sports** in which two athletes ==compete against each other== or as a team against another team of two people. Both of these are distinct from **team sports**, which involve ==larger numbers of athletes== working together against an opposing team made up of an ==equal number of competitors==.

**Sports** have been significantly been commended because of the benefits it may entail to one who wishes to engage with it. Perhaps some of the most notable benefits would be a ==healthy physique== and a ==positive mindset==. This being said, one could be easily persuaded to choose a **sport** for themselves.

However, among all the many sports recognized here in our country, which one would be best to consider? Generally, **sports** can be classified into three: **individual**, **dual**, and **team**. When choosing a **sport**, the classification can be of great help to identify which **sport** would sit best with one's self.

The main difference between **individual** and **dual sports** is the ==number of athletes== who compete on the same side. However, each **sport** comes with plenty of benefits and challenges.

## Individual Sports
Activities in which competing as a part of a team isn't required. The athlete is ==on their own== and is the one who's responsible for bringing home the win. Although **individual sports** can be competitive, the athlete is also in competition with themselves.

Practicing a **sport** individually requires ==plenty of motivation== in order to develop the skills that are needed to progress in the activity. Along with gaining additional skills, two other main benefits of **individual sports** are ==self-discipline and mental focus==. The more you practice, the better you can get, and you're the one who's responsible for reaching your goal.

However, one primary disadvantage of **individual sports** is that same responsibility: if you take competitions seriously and lose, you're ==responsible==, and it can be hard to push yourself to keep improving at times when you're only holding yourself accountable.

Sometimes, as in the case of gymnastics, individual athletes compete but are members of larger team. They're just performing, competing or being judged on their own. But typically, just because you're not a part of a big team when engaging in most **individual sports**, doesn't mean that you can't achieve great things.

Just take it from some of the biggest stars of **individual sports**. ***Usain Bolt*** is the fastest runner on the planet. He expressed that being a winner doesn't come easily, saying,

> *Yes, it looks easy. But it's not. There's a lot of work and dedication. It's rough. I want people to understand that what they see on the track is because I work so hard to get there*.

## Dual Sports
Compared to **individual sports**, there aren't as many dual sports out there. But, **dual sports** can take several different forms. In one form of **dual sports**, a single athlete competes against another single athlete; ==there's no team==, just two athletes against each other in a **one-on-one** match. **Dual sports** can also involve two athletes on the same team competing with two athletes of the opposite team, known as **two-on-two**.

**Dual sports** come with many benefits. Not only do they encourage ==a lot of discipline==, but they also involve utilizing ==analytical skills== and studying what's needed in order to beat your opponent. It greatly develops a ==strong sense of solidarity== and a ==sense of belongingness== for its players. Since this **sport** is played in ==pairs==, it is necessary to rely on and work together with the other player in order to succeed. Not only does this **sport** promote ==good sportsmanship==, but it also helps to bring out the best in others. This influences the athlete to be more **supportive**, **patient**, and **optimistic**, not just inside the court but outside as well.

While bringing your own skills to the court is impressive, you also have to know something about whom you're competing against. You can then ==make their weakness your strength== and ==study their techniques== to overcome them during play.

However, when one player is off their game for that day, it can affect both teammates. **Cooperation** is ==extremely important== in **dual sports**, and it's essential to get along with your teammate before trying to compete.

While this classification of **sport** has its own advantages, one should not disregard its disadvantages as well. The==social aspect== is definitely not a strength of this **sport**. Since the athlete competes alone in **individual sports**, the formation of bonds as those who play **dual sports** is ==not nurtured==. Another disadvantage is ==sowing unhealthy competition== between pairs. This can create a spiteful environment and can cause ==feelings of inadequacy== to the players.

Moreover, the lack of support from a co-athlete can be difficult in certain situations. During times of a losing streak, it is critical for the athlete to maintain their play when their confidence is gravely affected.
