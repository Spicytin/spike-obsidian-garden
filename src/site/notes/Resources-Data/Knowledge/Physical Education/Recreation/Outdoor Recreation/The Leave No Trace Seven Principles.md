## 1. Plan and Prepare
Adequate trip planning and preparation helps backcountry travelers accomplish trip goal safely and enjoyably, while ==simultaneously minimizing damage to the land==. Poor planning often results in ==miserable campers== and damage to natural and cultural resources. Rangers often tell stories of campers they have encountered who, because of poor planning and unexpected conditions, degrade backcountry resources and put themselves at risk.

### Importance of Trip Planning
* It helps ensure the safety of groups and individuals.
* It prepares you to Leave No Trace and ==minimizes resource damage==.
* It contributes to accomplishing trip goals safely and enjoyably.
* It increases self-confidence and opportunities for learning more about nature.

### Elements to Consider When Planning a Trip
* Identify and record the goals of your trip.
* Identify the skill and ability of trip participants.
* Gain knowledge of the area you plan to visit from land managers, maps, and literature.
* Choose equipment and clothing for comfort, safety, and Leave No Trace qualities.
* Plan trip activities to match your goals, skills, and abilities.
* Evaluate your trip upon return, note changes you will make next time.
* Other elements to consider:
	* Weather
	* Terrain
	* Regulations/restrictions
	* Private land boundaries
	* Average hiking speed of group and anticipated food consumption
	* Group size

## 2. Travel and Camp on Durable Surfaces
The goal of travel in the outdoors is to ==move through natural areas== while avoiding damage to the land or waterways. Understanding how travel causes impacts is necessary to accomplish this goal. Travel damage occurs when surface vegetation or communities of organisms are ==trampled beyond recovery==. The resulting barren area leads to ==soil erosion== and the development of undesirable trails. Backcountry travel may involve ==travel over both trails and off-trail areas==.


Selecting an appropriate campsite is perhaps the most important aspect of low-impact backcountry use. It requires the ==greatest degree of judgment and information==, and often involves making trade-offs between minimizing ecological and social impacts. A decision about where to camp should be based on information about the level and type of use in the area, the fragility of vegetation and soil, the likelihood of wildlife disturbance, an assessment of previous impacts, and your party's potential to cause or avoid impact.

## 3. Dispose of Waste Properly
Proper disposal of human waste is important to ==avoid pollution== of water sources, avoid the negative implications of someone else finding it, minimize the possibility of spreading disease and maximize the rate of decomposition.

## 4. Leave What You Find
Here's how to Leave What You Find:

+---------------------------------------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| **Great campsites are found, not man made**.      | Do not alter a campsite by ==cutting down trees or saplings==, peeling bark off of live trees, building lean-to's or log cabins, or by building additional fire rings.                                                                                                                     |
+---------------------------------------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| **Leave the trees alone.**                        | Do not hammer any nails, or signs in them, saw or break off branches, or carve your initials into them. All of these things can open the tree up to infection disease, and invasive insects that ==will kill the tree==.                                                                   |
+---------------------------------------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| **Let wild flowers grow.**                        | Do not pick wild flowers. Please leave them there for other visitors to enjoy. Not only does picking a few flowers mean there are less for others to see, it also means there are fewer plants around to ==reproduce and reseed== for next year. Take a picture or make a drawing instead. |
+---------------------------------------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| **Do not move or remove any cultural artifacts**. | Cultural artifacts include things like **arrowheads**, **pottery**, **grinding stones** or other tools, or even building structures.                                                                                                                                                       |
+---------------------------------------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

## 5. Minimize Campfire Impacts
Fires vs Stoves: The use of campfires, once a necessity for ==cooking and warmth==, is steeped in history and tradition. Some people would not think of camping without a campfire. Campfire building is also an important skill for every camper. Yet, the natural appearance of many areas has been degraded by the overuse of fires and an increasing demand for firewood. The development of lightweight, efficient camp stoves has encouraged a shift away from the traditional fire for cooking. Stoves have become essential equipment for minimum-impact camping. They are fast, flexible, and eliminate firewood availability as a concern in campsite selection. Stoves operate in almost any weather condition—and they Leave No Trace.

## 6. Respect Wildlife
Learn about wildlife through ==quiet observation==. Do not disturb wildlife or plants just for a "*better look*". Observe wildlife from a distance so they are ==not scared or forced to flee==. Large groups often cause more damage to the environment and can disturb wildlife so keep your group small. If you have a larger group, divide into smaller groups if possible, to ==minimize your impacts==.

Quick movements and loud noises are ==stressful== to animals. Travel quietly and do not pursue, feed, or force animals to flee. (One exception is in bear country where it is good to make a little noise so as not to startle to bears.). In hot or cold weather, disturbance can affect an animal's ability to ==withstand the rigorous environment==. Do not touch, get close to, feed or pick up wild animals. It is stressful to the animal, and it is possible that the animal may harbor rabies or other diseases.

## 7. Be Considerate of Other Visitors
One of the most important components of outdoor ethics is to maintain ==courtesy towards other visitors==. It helps everyone enjoy their outdoor experience. Many people come to the outdoors to listen to nature. Excessive noise, uncontrolled pets, and damaged surroundings take away from the natural appeal of the outdoors.
