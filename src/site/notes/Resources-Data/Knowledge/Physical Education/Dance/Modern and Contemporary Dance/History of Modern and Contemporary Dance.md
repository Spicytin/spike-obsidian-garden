## Modern Dance
Modern dancers still rely on many ballet steps as part of their choreographed modern dance routines. Modern dance is deeply embedded in ballet syllabus. Historically, modern dance began as free form style lyrical ballet among a community of professional ballet dancers who refused to stop dancing. ***Isadora Duncan*** and ***Ruth St. Denis*** promoted modern dance as a way of continuing their dance careers, according to their biographies. The first modern dances choreographed required no dancing en pointe or rigid adherence to ballet movement.

Following the early pioneers like *Duncan* and *St. Denis*, the middle period saw the rise of the "second generation" of modern dancers, including figures like ***Martha Graham***, ***Doris Humphrey***, and ***Charles Weidman***. These artists sought to codify the rebellious spirit of early modern dance into specific, teachable training systems. *Graham*, for example, developed the principle of "contraction and release," a method based on breathing and muscle control that gave her choreography a distinct, angular look. *Humphrey*, along with *Weidman*, created a technique based on the concept of "fall and recovery," which explored the body's relationship with gravity. This generation established modern dance as a legitimate and independent art form with its own language of movement, moving beyond pure self-expression to create structured, repeatable choreography.
