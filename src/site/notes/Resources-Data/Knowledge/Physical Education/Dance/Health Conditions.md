When the body does not have enough fluid needed to function normally, it is **dehydrated**. This happens when lost body fluid are not replaced. **Dehydration** causes a person to have a ==dry thirsty mouth==, become **fatigued**, have ==less urine yield with dark color==, and in severe case, **unconsciousness**.

The usual causes of **dehydration** are hot weather condition, too much **perspiration**, high **fever**, **diarrhea**, **vomiting**, and excessive exercise without taking in enough fluid. To nurse **dehydration**, the body will need to ==replenish lost fluids and electrolytes==.

Drink at least ==eight glasses of water a day== and ==up to 12 glasses during summer months==. **Hydration** is also the soundest way to prevent **dehydration**. ==Prevention is better than cure==, and the ways to prevent dehydration include the intake of adequate fluids, watery fruits and vegetables and avoiding hot environment.

The following are terminologies that you might experience if we opt to observe personal safety protocols during **_MVPA_** activities:

- **Dehydration** - happens when the fluid in your body is ==used or lost more than the fluid you drink or intake==. If your body does not have enough water to fluid to do its normal functions, hence, you get **dehydrated**. Anyone may become **dehydrated**, as to the people who are more at risk, young ones or children and the older adults are more at risk.
- **Overexertion** - the pressure one puts in himself/herself, too much pressure that leads to a simple discomfort that might extended to a more serious injury.
- **Hypothermia** - usually happens when the body easily ==loses temperature==. A person suffers **hypothermia** when his/her body temperature drops below ==35 C==.
- **Hyperthermia** - opposite of **hypothermia**. It happens when the body temperature ==rises up significantly beyond the normal temperature== which is ==37 C==. **Hyperthermia** like **hypothermia** can threaten life too.
