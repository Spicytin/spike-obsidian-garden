Cultural dances performed to the ==strong beats of percussion instruments== by a community of people sharing the same culture, usually done in honor of a **Patron Saint** or in Thanksgiving of a bountiful harvest.

**Festival dances** may be religious or secular in nature. But the best thing about festivals is that they add to the merrymaking and festivities where they are celebrated, the reason why they are called **festival dances** after all. Mostly are influenced by the coming of the **Spaniards** who colonized us and brought **Christianity** in the country.

**Festival dances** draw the people's culture by portraying the people's ways of life through **movements**, **costumes**, and **implements** inherent to their place of origin. Many others, especially from Luzon, are now paving their way to join the country's festival of festivals, the **Aliwan Fiesta** which is done in the month of ==April==. Filipinos do festivals primarily to celebrate. There are a multitude of reasons for this reason. We celebrate our unity amidst the diversity of cultures, and we celebrate our industry bringing about a beautiful harvest. **Festivals** have been a consistent crowd-producing activity leading to ==upliftment of a community's economy== due to its ==tourism and entertainment value==. Basically, **festivals** are a ==form of entertainment== that attract ==foreign and domestic tourists== to visit a place eventually leading to the elevation of the Filipino's quality of life. Whatever festival we celebrate, be it done to ==honor a religious icon== or ==celebrate our industry==. **Festival dances** are a ==reflection of the unity of the Filipino community== that despite the economic, social, environmental, cultural, and political challenges we face every day, there can be no other race more resilient than ours.

**Festivals**, as mentioned earlier, may either be religious, in honor of a certain religious icon or secular or non-religious, in Thanksgiving or celebration of people's industry and bountiful harvest. The following are some of the said festivals:
