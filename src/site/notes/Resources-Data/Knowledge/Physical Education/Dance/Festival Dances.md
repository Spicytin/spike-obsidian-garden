Cultural dances performed to the ==strong beats of percussion instruments== by a community of people sharing the same culture, usually done in honor of a **Patron Saint** or in Thanksgiving of a bountiful harvest.

**Festival dances** may be religious or secular in nature. But the best thing about festivals is that they add to the merrymaking and festivities where they are celebrated, the reason why they are called **festival dances** after all. Mostly are influenced by the coming of the **Spaniards** who colonized us and brought **Christianity** in the country.

**Festival dances** draw the people's culture by portraying the people's ways of life through **movements**, **costumes**, and **implements** inherent to their place of origin. Many others, especially from Luzon, are now paving their way to join the country's festival of festivals, the **Aliwan Fiesta** which is done in the month of ==April==. Filipinos do festivals primarily to celebrate. There are a multitude of reasons for this reason. We celebrate our unity amidst the diversity of cultures, and we celebrate our industry bringing about a beautiful harvest. **Festivals** have been a consistent crowd-producing activity leading to ==upliftment of a community's economy== due to its ==tourism and entertainment value==. Basically, **festivals** are a ==form of entertainment== that attract ==foreign and domestic tourists== to visit a place eventually leading to the elevation of the Filipino's quality of life. Whatever festival we celebrate, be it done to ==honor a religious icon== or ==celebrate our industry==. **Festival dances** are a ==reflection of the unity of the Filipino community== that despite the economic, social, environmental, cultural, and political challenges we face every day, there can be no other race more resilient than ours.

**Festivals**, as mentioned earlier, may either be religious, in honor of a certain religious icon or secular or non-religious, in Thanksgiving or celebration of people's industry and bountiful harvest. The following are some of the said festivals:

If you are planning to participate in these group dances, take note that injuries may occur when a person engages in **Moderate to Vigorous Physical Activity** (***MVPA***). **Dancing** is a ==vigorous activity==. Some people get injured when they are not in proper condition. No proper warm-up and stretching before you dance or exercise can also lead to injuries.

## Most common injuries
* **Sprain** - tear of ligament fibers, muscles or tendons supporting a joint. This can occur when a joint is ==extended beyond its normal range of movement==. A **sprain** may involve a small number of fibers through to a complete rupture. In extreme circumstances, the fibers of the ligament, muscle or tendon may remain intact and rip from the bone.
* **Contusion** or **bruise** - bleeding into the soft tissue. It is caused by a ==direct blow== from another person, an implement or an object.
* **Concussion** - caused by a ==direct blow to the head==. Depending on the severity of the concussion, injury can cause varying levels of implement of brain function. **Concussions** are categorized depending upon symptoms:

| **Category** | **Grade Level** |
| ------------ | --------------- |
| **Mild**     | 1               |
| **Moderate** | 2               |
| **Severe**   | 3               |
* **Dislocation** - occurs when the ball of a joint is ==forced out of its socket== (i.e. arm forced out of the shoulder joint). A **dislocation** must be reset by proper medical professional.
* **Fracture** - break, crack, or shattering of a bone. In **closed fractures**, the broken does ==not pierce the skin==, while in **open fractures**, the broken bone ==breaks the skin surface==.
* **Strains** - injuries that involve the stretching, partial tearing, or complete tearing of a tendon. **Strains** are categorized as *first*, *second*, or *third degree*. **Chronic strains** are injuries that ==gradually build up from overuse or repetitive stress==.

## Kinds of injuries
* **Acute injuries** - occur suddenly when or exercising. **Sprained ankles**, **strained backs**, and **fractured hands** are acute injuries. Signs of an acute injury include:
	* **Sudden, severe pain**
	* **Swelling**
	* **Not being able to place weight on a leg, knee, ankle, or foot**
	* **An arm, elbow, wrist, hand, or finger that is very tender**
	* **Not being able to move a joint as normal**
	* **Extreme leg or arm weakness**
	* **A bone or joint that is visibly out of place**
* **Chronic injuries** - happen after you dance a sport
