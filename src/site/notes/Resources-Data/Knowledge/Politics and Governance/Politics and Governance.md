## Politics

An activity that involves the interaction of people whose relationship is characterized by ==conflict and cooperation==, and come together to solve such disagreements through binding solutions (***Heywood***, *2013*, ***History of Politics***). It is also a social activity which underlies the creation of ==maintenance and amendment of social norms and rules==. It is also the art and science of the government concerning the realm of public affairs or the state.

The world politics is derived from *polis*, meaning literally "==city state==". Ancient Greek society was divided into a collection of independent city states, each of which possessed its own system of government. The largest and most influential of these city-states was ***Athens***, often portrayed as the ==cradle of democratic government==. In this light, poltiics can be understood to refer to the affairs of the *polis* – in effect, "*what concerns the polis*".
This view of politics is clearly evident in the everyday use of the term: people are said to be "*in politics*" when they hold public office, or to be "*entering politics*" when they seek to do so.

Politics is thus inextricably linked to the phenomena of conflict and cooperation. The existence of rival opinions, different wants, competing needs and opposing interests guarantees disagreement about the rules under which people live. According to ***Hannah Arendt***, political power acts in a concert. However, people recognize that, in order to influence these rules or ensure that they are upheld, they must work with others.

## Governance
The exercise of ==power/authority== by a political leader for the well-being of their country's citizens or subject. It also refers to the manner of ==steering/governing== and/or directing and controlling a group of people or the state.

The importance of studying governance includes the people, most specifically the citizens, who will be aware of the need for good governance. Consequently, such awareness should encourage them to take action. For the achievement of continued empowerment and sustainable development, they have to learn how to fight for their rights through proper awareness on how the Philippine Governance works.
