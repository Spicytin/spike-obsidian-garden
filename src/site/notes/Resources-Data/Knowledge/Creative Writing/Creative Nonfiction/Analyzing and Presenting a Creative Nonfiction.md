## Unlocking of Difficulties
1. **Summary** - a synthesis of the key ideas of a piece of writing, ==restated in your words== (i.e. paraphrased). You may write a summary as a standalone assignment or as part of a longer paper. Whenever you summarize, you must be careful not to copy the exact wording of the original source.
2. **Textual analysis** - a methodology that involves understanding **language**, **symbols**, and/or **pictures** present in texts to gain information regarding how people make sense of and communicate life and life experiences. **Visual**, **written**, or **spoken messages** provide cues to ways through which communication may be understood.
3. **Commenting** - a **remark**, **criticism**, or **observation**, **talk** or **gossip**. It is a note, explaining or criticizing a passage in a text. It is an ==explanatory or critical matter== added to a text.
4. **Artistic Presentation of a Creative Nonfiction Work** - the literary appearance, or performance and staging of a **creative nonfiction** work.

## Learning about it
1. **Read the work thoroughly**. You may do a second or third reading of the piece if you think you are still missing some aspects of the text worth focusing on.
2. **First, focus on content**. What is the work about? Then move on to "*What is the writer telling you?*"
3. **When you are done reading for content, you can start analyzing the writer's technique**. What **creative nonfiction** form was used by the writer? Why do you think the writer chose this form over other forms? Would it have made a difference if it was a **reflective essay**, or a **travelogue**, or a **biography**?
4. **From technique, move on to the writer's style**. What creative storytelling techniques were used by the writer? How did he or she hook up the reader in the beginning part of the piece? Was it sufficiently sustained? How did the writer cap the work? Was it an effective conclusion?
5. **Finally, talk about the work's overall impression**. How did the work make you feel? What do you think was the writer's purpose in writing the piece? Do you think the work was able to fulfill that purpose?
