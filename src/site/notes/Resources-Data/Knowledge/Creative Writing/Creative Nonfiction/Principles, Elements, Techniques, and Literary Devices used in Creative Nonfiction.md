## Principles

| **Principle**              | **Definition**                                                                                       | **Example**                                                                    |
| -------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Factuality**             | Content must be ==true== and based on ==verified events or research==.                               | A memoir about surviving a natural disaster                                    |
| **Narrativity**            | Tells a story with a ==beginning, middle, and end==.                                                 | A personal essay that recounts a journey home after years abroad.              |
| **Literary Prose Style**   | Uses ==literary elements== like **imagery**, **metaphor**, and **dialogue** to enrich the narrative. | "*The sky wore a gray coat of sorrow.*"                                        |
| **Subjectivity and Voice** | Includes the ==writer's personal feelings, insights, and tone==.                                     | A reflective essay about one's experience of failure, written in first person. |
| **Reflection and Insight** | Goes beyond telling events to explore what they mean.                                                | "*It wasn't just a dog dying; it was the end of my childhood*"                 |
| **Accuracy with Artistry** | Blends ==factual accuracy with artistic storytelling== while maintaining ethical integrity.          | Reconstructing a real conversation based on notes or memory.                   |
| **Scene Building**         | Uses ==descriptive storytelling== to recreate vivid events.                                          | Describing in detail the setting of a hospital waiting room during a crisis.   |
