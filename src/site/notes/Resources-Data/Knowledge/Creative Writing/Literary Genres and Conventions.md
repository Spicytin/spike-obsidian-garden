## Conventions of Traditional Genres
There are two kinds of words:
* **Literal word** - exactly as it says (e.g. The dictionary defines the apple as a round, red or green edible fruit.)
* **Non-literal language** - figurative or the transfer of a different meaning to the **literal word** (e.g. The apple can be used in a saying "*an apple a day keeps the doctor away*" which promotes good health.)
