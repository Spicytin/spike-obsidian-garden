* A narrative, written from the perspective of the author, about an important part of their life.
* It still include all facts of the event, but the author has more flexibility here because he/she is telling a story as he/she remembers it, not as others can prove or disprove it.
* Known as "==***memoire***==" in French.

## Types of Memoir
1. **Confessional** - the author shares ==painful or difficult secrets== about themselves or their family and how it has affected them.
2. **Professional/celebrity** - covers important moments in the author's rise to fame and success.
3. **Travel** - let us ==escape with the author== and learn about a time and place through their experiences.
