The **kidneys** are ==two bean-shaped organs==, each about the ==size of a fist==. They are located in the ==middle of the back==, just below the **rip cage**, on either side of the **spine**.

The **kidneys** are also ==vital organs== that regulate the composition of the blood. When **kidneys** are healthy, the **artery** (***AR-ter-ee***) brings blood and waste from the bloodstream into the **kidney**. **Kidneys** clean the blood, then waste and extra fluid go out into the **urine** through the **ureter**. Clean blood leaves the **kidney** and goes back into the bloodstream through the vein.

## What the kidneys do
* Keep the blood clean and ==chemically balanced==
* Keep the volume of water in the body constant
* Removes wastes in the body
* They help regulate **blood pressure**
* Stimulate the making of **red blood cells**; and
* Maintain the body's **calcium** level
