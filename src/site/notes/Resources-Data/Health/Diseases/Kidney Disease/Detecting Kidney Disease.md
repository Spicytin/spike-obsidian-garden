Since you can have kidney disease without any symptoms, your doctor may first detect the condition through ==routine blood and urine tests==. The ***National Kidney Foundation*** recommends three simple tests to screen for kidney disease:
* A **blood pressure** measurement
* A spot check for protein or albumin in the **urine** (***proteinuria***); and
* A calculation of **glomerular filtration rate** (***GFR***) based on a **serum creatinine** measurement
