Seeing a Milky Way may be the greatest achievement inside and outside the astronomy, especially for those who live in an urban areas (city, town, etc.) with light pollution. For me, it is.

I happened to seen it once, together with mom and dad, during a scheduled brownout in our city a year ago. Before that, I suddenly woke up in the very early morning, hearing my dad failing to start the generator in our garage just to get our electric fans and phone chargers to work again in our bedroom. So, my parents and I decided to walk up to our terrace in upstairs to get some cool, fresh air, along bringing my tripod in case I want to take photos of the night sky. To my surprise, there were no lights around, though we have a bright solar light that lighted our terrace's door. And because of this, we saw more stars than usual.

However, while we were on our terrace, we noticed this dark grayish cloud that is barely visible to our naked eyes in the sky above our heads, next to the moving clouds being in the way. I thought I saw a Milky Way for the first time, so I tried to confirm it by opening the star map app Stellarium on my phone, then pointed it to that cloud. And then I was like, woah, it is actually a Milky Way galaxy I was talking about!

It got my autistic mind excited that I had to hurry to mount my phone to my tripod and then took several pictures of it. The photos were really wonderful, and I was amazed after checking them later before we head back to bed at 5 AM, waiting for our electricity to be back. After that, the galaxy is never to be seen again, until then...
