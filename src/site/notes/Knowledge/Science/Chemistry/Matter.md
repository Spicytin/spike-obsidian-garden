Anything that ==has mass and occupies space==. Everything on Earth has mass and takes up space.

## States of Matter
* **Solid**
* **Liquid**
* **Gas** 
* **Plasma**

| **Properties**                 | **Solids**                        | **Liquids**                      | **Gases**                                |
| ------------------------------ | --------------------------------- | -------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| **Distance between particles** | Very close together               | Close, but with small gaps       | Far apart                                |
| **Molecular arrangement**      | Tightly packed in a fixed pattern | Random but still close           | Random and far apart                     |
| **Shape**                      | Definite shape                    | Takes the shape of the container | No define shape; fills the container     |
| **Volume**                     | Definite volume                   | Definite volume                  | Indefinite volume; expands to fill space |
| **Speed of movement**          | Very slow (vibrating only)        | Moderate                         | Very fast                                |
| **Forces of attraction**       | Very strong                       | Moderate                         | Very weak                                |

## Classifications
**Pure Substance** - one material with same composition.

e.g.:
* table sugar
* table salt
* distilled water
* oxygen gas
	**Element** - the simplest form of matter with just one atom.
	**Compound** - two or more atoms.

**Mixture** - two or more substances combined physically. 

e.g.:
* iodized salt
* soft drinks
* brown sugar
* human breath
	**Homogenous** - uniformly distributed (*formula: solute + solvent = solution*)
	e.g. rubbing alcohol, carbonated soft drinks, human breath
	**Heterogenous** - chemically combined
	e.g. water oil, salt and pepper

### Examples of Heterogenous Mixtures
1. **suspension** - sand + water
2. **colloid** - milk (*Tyndall effect*)
