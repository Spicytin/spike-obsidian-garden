Philippine literary production during the American Period in the Philippines was spurred by two significant developments in education and culture. One is the introduction of free public instruction for all children of school age and two, the use of English as medium of instruction in all levels of education in public schools.

Free public education made knowledge and information accessible to a greater number of Filipinos. Those who availed of this education through college were able to improve their social status and joined a good number of educated masses who became part of the country’s middle class.

The use of English as medium of instruction introduced Filipinos to Anglo-American modes of thought, culture and life ways that would be embedded not only in the literature produced but also in the psyche of the country’s educated class. It was this educated class that would be the wellspring of a vibrant Philippine Literature in English.

Philippine literature in English, as a direct result of American colonization of the country, could not escape being imitative of American models of writing, especially during its period of apprenticeship. The poetry written by early poets manifested studied attempts at versification, as in the following poem which is proof of the poet’s rather elementary exercise in the English language:

Vacation days at last are here,

And we have time for fun so dear,

All boys and girls do gladly cheer,

This welcomed season of the year.

In early June in school we’ll meet;

A harder task shall we complete

And if we fail we must repeat

That self same task without retreat.

We simply rest to come again

To school where boys and girls obtain

The Creator’s gift to men

Whose sanguine hopes in us remain.

Vacation means a time for play

For young and old in night and day

My wish for all is to be gay,

And evil none lead you astray
