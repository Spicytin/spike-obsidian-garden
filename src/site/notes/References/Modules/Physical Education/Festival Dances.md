Cultural dances performed to the ==strong beats of percussion instruments== by a community of people sharing the same culture, usually done in honor of a **Patron Saint** or in Thanksgiving of a bountiful harvest.

**Festival dances** may be religious or secular in nature. But the best thing about festivals is that they add to the merrymaking and festivities where they are celebrated, the reason why they are called **festival dances** after all. Mostly are influenced by the coming of the **Spaniards** who colonized us and brought **Christianity** in the country.

**Festival dances** draw the people's culture by portraying the people's ways of life through **movements**, **costumes**, and **implements** inherent to their place of origin. Many others, especially from Luzon, are now paving their way to join the country's festival of festivals, the **Aliwan Fiesta** which is done in the month of ==April==. Filipinos do festivals primarily to celebrate. There are a multitude of reasons for this reason. We celebrate our unity amidst the diversity of cultures, and we celebrate our industry bringing about a beautiful harvest. **Festivals** have been a consistent crowd-producing activity leading to ==upliftment of a community's economy== due to its ==tourism and entertainment value==. Basically, **festivals** are a ==form of entertainment== that attract ==foreign and domestic tourists== to visit a place eventually leading to the elevation of the Filipino's quality of life. Whatever festival we celebrate, be it done to ==honor a religious icon== or ==celebrate our industry==. **Festival dances** are a ==reflection of the unity of the Filipino community== that despite the economic, social, environmental, cultural, and political challenges we face every day, there can be no other race more resilient than ours.

**Festivals**, as mentioned earlier, may either be religious, in honor of a certain religious icon or secular or non-religious, in Thanksgiving or celebration of people's industry and bountiful harvest. The following are some of the said festivals:

If you are planning to participate in these group dances, take note that injuries may occur when a person engages in **Moderate to Vigorous Physical Activity** (***MVPA***). **Dancing** is a ==vigorous activity==. Some people get injured when they are not in proper condition. No proper warm-up and stretching before you dance or exercise can also lead to injuries.

## Most common injuries
* **Sprain** - tear of ligament fibers, muscles or tendons supporting a joint. This can occur when a joint is ==extended beyond its normal range of movement==. A **sprain** may involve a small number of fibers through to a complete rupture. In extreme circumstances, the fibers of the ligament, muscle or tendon may remain intact and rip from the bone.
* **Contusion** or **bruise** - bleeding into the soft tissue. It is caused by a ==direct blow== from another person, an implement or an object.
* **Concussion** - caused by a ==direct blow to the head==. Depending on the severity of the concussion, injury can cause varying levels of implement of brain function. **Concussions** are categorized depending upon symptoms:

| **Category** | **Grade Level** |
| ------------ | --------------- |
| **Mild**     | 1               |
| **Moderate** | 2               |
| **Severe**   | 3               |
* **Dislocation** - occurs when the ball of a joint is ==forced out of its socket== (i.e. arm forced out of the shoulder joint). A **dislocation** must be reset by proper medical professional.
* **Fracture** - break, crack, or shattering of a bone. In **closed fractures**, the broken does ==not pierce the skin==, while in **open fractures**, the broken bone ==breaks the skin surface==.
* **Strains** - injuries that involve the stretching, partial tearing, or complete tearing of a tendon. **Strains** are categorized as *first*, *second*, or *third degree*. **Chronic strains** are injuries that ==gradually build up from overuse or repetitive stress==.

## Kinds of injuries
* **Acute injuries** - occur suddenly when or exercising. **Sprained ankles**, **strained backs**, and **fractured hands** are acute injuries. Signs of an acute injury include:
	* **Sudden, severe pain**
	* **Swelling**
	* **Not being able to place weight on a leg, knee, ankle, or foot**
	* **An arm, elbow, wrist, hand, or finger that is very tender**
	* **Not being able to move a joint as normal**
	* **Extreme leg or arm weakness**
	* **A bone or joint that is visibly out of place**
* **Chronic injuries** - happen after you dance a sport or exercise for a long time. Signs of a **chronic injury** include:
	* **Pain when you exercise or dance**
	* **A dull ache when you rest**
	* **Swelling**

## Common injury factors
1. **Poor body alignment and technique** - the anatomical alignment and technique of the dancer are some of the ==intrinsic factors== that are commonly associated with injury. **Dance** requires moving the limbs in a ==controlled and precise manner==. These movements are ==anchored to the trunk==, which means that the **trunk** should be ==stable== and the **spine** is ==aligned== and low trunk stability can lead to ==uncoordinated movements==, which predispose an individual to injury.
2. **Excessive training duration and intensity** - excessive training and limited recovery impairs the ability to ==heal and repair damaged issues==. Intense technique training will most likely lead to ==microscopic injury== to the musculoskeletal structures due to ==repetitive loading==. Without proper rest and sufficient nutrition, the body is not able to rebuild the tissues, and this predisposes the dancer to a severe injury. An abrupt increase in training intensity will also lead to this scenario.
3. **Hard dance floor** - the floor is where dancers ==rehearse and perform==. An optimal dance floor should be able to absorb the impact that is generated by the performer. A hard floor does not help in dissipating the impact and returns the force to the dancer. The repetitive shock absorbed by the foot would eventually damage the foot or other parts of the lower extremity.
4. **Poor shoe design** - **footwear** corrects foot mechanics and ==reduce the impact== on the foot. A shoe that does not fit properly or has insufficient shock absorption will significantly contribute to injury risk. Furthermore, some materials used on the shoes do not offer sufficient traction on the floor and this could lead to slips and falls.
5. **Muscle imbalance** - an ==uncoordinated muscle action== because of uneven strength between muscle groups. This is attributed to various factors such as anatomy, technique, and past injury.

## Steps to prevent injury
* Develop a **fitness plan** that includes **cardiovascular exercise**, **strength training** and **flexibility**. This will help decrease your chance of injury.
* Alternate exercising different muscle groups and exercise every other day.
* Cool down properly after exercise or dance. It should take two times as long as you're warm up.
* Stay hydrated. Drink water to prevent **dehydration**, **heat exhaustion**, and **heat stroke**.
* Stretching exercises can improve the ability of muscles to ==contract and perform==, reducing the risk for injury. Each stretch should start slowly until you reach a point of muscle tension. **Stretching** should not be painful. Aim to hold each stretch for ==up to 20 seconds==.
* Use the right equipment or gear and wear shoes that provide support and that may correct certain foot problems that can lead to injury.
* Learn the right techniques to perform your dance.

When the body does not have enough fluid needed to function normally, it is **dehydrated**. This happens when lost body fluid are not replaced. **Dehydration** causes a person to have a ==dry thirsty mouth==, become **fatigued**, have ==less urine yield with dark color==, and in severe case, **unconsciousness**.

The usual causes of **dehydration** are hot weather condition, too much **perspiration**, high **fever**, **diarrhea**, **vomiting**, and excessive exercise without taking in enough fluid. To nurse **dehydration**, the body will need to ==replenish lost fluids and electrolytes==.

Drink at least ==eight glasses of water a day== and ==up to 12 glasses during summer months==. **Hydration** is also the soundest way to prevent **dehydration**. ==Prevention is better than cure==, and the ways to prevent dehydration include the intake of adequate fluids, watery fruits and vegetables and avoiding hot environment.

The following are terminologies that you might experience if we opt to observe personal safety protocols during ***MVPA*** activities:
* **Dehydration** - happens when the fluid in your body is ==used or lost more than the fluid you drink or intake==. If your body does not have enough water to fluid to do its normal functions, hence, you get **dehydrated**. Anyone may become **dehydrated**, as to the people who are more at risk, young ones or children and the older adults are more at risk.
* **Overexertion** - the pressure one puts in himself/herself, too much pressure that leads to a simple discomfort that might extended to a more serious injury.
* **Hypothermia** - usually happens when the body easily ==loses temperature==. A person suffers **hypothermia** when his/her body temperature drops below ==35 C==.
* **Hyperthermia** - opposite of **hypothermia**. It happens when the body temperature ==rises up significantly beyond the normal temperature== which is ==37 C==. **Hyperthermia** like **hypothermia** can threaten life too.
